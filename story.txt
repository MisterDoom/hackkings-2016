Questions? Comments? Gravy Jokes? Leave'em below!Anna hated stubble. There wasn't a feeling in the world that annoyed her like the feeling of hairs on her legs. She shaved daily, trying to prevent those little spots, but they kept growing, and growing. Waxing didn't help long enough, lasers weren't reliable yet, she had tried every miracle product and none worked, so she shaved. 
She'd spent the last hour trying to get to the root of the problem. The blades scraped untill they were blunt, but she just kept seeing those damn hairs. It was maddening. Tired and slightly lightheaded, she took a break to check on her progress.
A smile spread across Anna's face. She laughed happily as she put a new razor blade on her leg. Almost there. After all, her problem was only skin deep.Two days ago, my camera broke. Accidentally dropped it in a pool if you're wondering and I was going on holiday in a few weeks so I quickly needed a replacement. A new camera was too expensive so I had to resort to eBay to replace my ruined camera.
I browsed a few pages and noted a few good examples when I stumbled on a great deal, a camera exactly my own but it was being sold for a tenth of the price! The seller had a lot of positive feedback and the images showed that it was in perfect order so I quickly placed a bid and waited, two days later, the camera was mine.
I gave my address to the seller, gave the man his money and eagerly awaited my purchase. I soon received a simple brown package with a label showing my sending details and quickly opened it to see my new camera. I snapped a few shots and it was as he said, but before I was finished, I decided to check the SD card.
I plugged it into my crappy $600 laptop and saw there was one folder labeled "PICTURES", I opened it to see seven pictures unimaginatively labeled 001, 002, 003 etc. I clicked on 001 to see a shipping label, a bit weird but nothing more. The next picture left me trembling. It was a corpse. A freshly murdered 
. I quickly went to the next picture to see what was next. It was another shipping label, I knew what was next but was still sick when I saw it. It was like this until I reached 007. It was my shipping address.
That's why I'm writing this, I just heard knocking on my door. It hasn't stopped in 20 minutes and is only getting harder. I called 911 a quarter of an hour ago but they won't be here in time. Because I just heard my dining room window shatter.There once was a small forest nearby a small village that the locals called the Forest of Laughter. It was an attraction for many of the villager’s children, to go and spend their days playing in the forest ‘til the sunset, while the adults were working in the fields. It got that name, because sometimes, if the wind was right, and the ground was calm, you could hear the children’s laughter coming from those woods. The younglings were usually found playing in a naked small field, that was located in the middle of the forest, that the villagers referred to as the Oak Field. It was covered with a short moist grass, that always felt like it was coated in a morning dew and it stayed that way even on hottest of days. At the center of this field, there was an old, thick branched oak tree. It had many carvings of the children names on its trunk, some cuts were so deep, the sap from the oak never stopped bleeding, as the wounds were too deep to heal. The villagers, both young and old loved the forest, for what it provided to the little community.
On one of the sunsets, however, a villager’s daughter Gloria, an eight year old with a yellow dress didn't return from the forest as usual. When other kids, who came back from it, were asked by the worried father, if they've seen her, they all just shook their heads. The country men gathered the torches and began the search. The whole forest was searched, throughout the night and day, inch by inch, but the girl was never found.
Few days later, when the search was over, to the surprise of the villagers and the mourning father, little Gloria emerged from the woods right before the sunset. The strangest thing was that the girl was happy and laughing, as if nothing bad have happened. When asked where she was those past few days, she simply shrugged her shoulders and said: “I was just playing with the kids.”
Few days later, the daughter’s father decided to go into the forest alone, while the girl was sleeping at home. He took his torch and went into the woods just as the sunset light has scorched the sky with its reddish tint. As he reached the Oak Field, he noticed a small silhouette resting on the grass, it’s back leaned to the old Oak. Once he reached the silhouette, the light of torch revealed something that made the man paralyzed for a moment. It was a corpse of a little girl in a yellow dress. Above her head, on the Oak’s trunk there was a fresh carve, from which the sap continued to bleed out. It read “Gloria”. Once he read it, his horrified eyes stared back to the direction of the village as he silently asked himself: “Who is she?”
As the sun completely set, and the red sky turned black, you could hear the children's laughter from the forest as it took another prey.I'm always finding stray hairs all over the place. 
My apartment is covered in them. Some are in the usual places. On my pillow, on my bathroom counter, and in the drain of my shower. Others are in more weirder locations like in my refrigerator and on the ceiling fan. A few even end up in my mouth. I can't help but feel unnerved when I come across them. I shouldn't feel uncomfortable with finding stray hairs in my living space. 
An explanation is in order. I'm a woman, one who has a full head of hair and who likes to grow it out. My hair is thick and usually falls off on its own so, I should expect rogue strands. 
That being said, I shouldn't expect them to be short and black when I'm a brunette. 'Oh yes, we have a ghost,' your hostess says, as she leads you to your bedroom.
Of course the place would be haunted. The inn is ancient – more than 500 years old. But this was meant to be a relaxing holiday. 'Go somewhere quiet,' your doctor had told you. 'No surprises. Just somewhere to rest, in peace.' If only your car hadn't broken down, leaving you stuck out here all night.
'It's a bit boring really,' she continues, with a shrug. 'Nobody has ever never seen anything – just heard footsteps occasionally.' 
As your hostess bids you goodnight and closes the door, you fight against the urge to run to it and barricade yourself in. Instead, you make yourself walk to the door, lock it slowly, and then slowly and carefully go to the window and draw the curtains. As you lie down you take more deep breaths until your heartbeat slows and you feel calm again.
As you settle down under the covers you soon find yourself drifting off. Only to hear a sound coming from outside your door, in the corridor. Footsteps? No, not footsteps. don't be ridiculous. You are hearing things. Probably just a waking dream. You gradually drift back to sleep again. Only to hear – footsteps. Yes, definitely footsteps, and not from a guest. These are hollow, peculiar, and seem to come from the other end of time. Why are you frightening yourself like this? They make your hair stand on end. How could you have thought they were a dream? They have stopped. No, they will keep on coming. They will not stop. Your heart is hammering faster and faster. Please, stop! Your breath comes out in shuddering gasps, and you cannot stop it. The footsteps coming closer and closer, louder and louder until – suddenly, there is silence.
Now you are not afraid any more. In fact, you feel strangely lighthearted. What an idiot you were! To be actually afraid of a noise! A noise cannot hurt you. You laugh to yourself and turn over to go back to sleep, but strangely, considering how tired you were before, sleep eludes you. Instead, you sit up to see a very curious thing. Slowly, tendrils of mist are gathering at the end of your bed. You watch, entranced, as they form themselves into – a ghost! A whiskery old man, dressed in pantaloons, an old style coat and neckerchief, sitting on the end of your bed, looking at you. But you are not a bit scared. Instead you are just merely intrigued. You remember the story from earlier.
'What an odd thing,' you say, and your voice sounds hoarse in your ears. 'My hostess said nobody had ever seen the ghost.'
'Nobody living,' the ghost replies with a sinister grin. 'Your heart stopped beating five minutes ago.'Silently, I stood before the open casket, gazing down at my sister's face. "Bethany? Are you okay?" my father asked, his hand upon my shoulder. "I just...I can't believe she's gone." I whispered, my voice trembling. "If I hadn't lost touch with her-" "Oh, honey." my mother said, hugging me as I began to cry. "Don't blame yourself. Nobody knew Victoria was going to poison herself, even with the problems she had." Still, I feel bad." I said through sobs. "Even after the times she picked on me, I still loved her." "We know, dear." My father replied. "You've always been as sweet as Momma's pumpkin pie." "Thanks, Daddy." I said meekly. "Do you want to ride home with us?" my mother then asked. "Thanks, Momma, but I'm not quite ready to leave Vicki just yet. Besides, I got Patrick here with me." "Okay, darlin',  we'll see you at the house then." "Okay." I said. They both then gave me a sad smile before leaving me alone with my sister's corpse.

  Once I was sure they were gone, I wiped the tears away and rolled my eyes in disgust. "That was quite the performance, sugar." Patrick said as he entered the room. "Why, thank you." I replied before he pulled me in for a kiss. "Sweet as Momma's pumpkin pie, like Daddy always says. Though not as sweet as candy yams drizzled with antifreeze. One would've thought she drank too much wine the way it affected her." "That's for sure." he replied, wrapping his arms around me. "Deep down, I always preferred my pumpkin pie with a bit more spice." He then grinned mischievously, making my heart skip a beat. "God, I love you, Mr. Mason." "And I love you, Mrs. Mason." Mrs. Mason. The sound of it filled me with joy. I was finally in the spotlight. I then took one last look at my twin's face. "Sweet dreams, Beth." I giggled as I closed the casket's lid.He was crotchety, irritable – the skin on his face more like melted candle-wax than human flesh – but for an 125-year-old, he was surprisingly alert.
I carefully considered how to begin the conversation, while children, unperturbed by our presence, milled about the classroom.
“Today, I'm meeting with the last living person to have directly witnessed the religious genocide 115 years ago...”
I hadn't even completed my introduction before he interjected. “There was no genocide.”
“I understand that's your position...”
“I was here, 
 it allegedly happened,” he said, swirling his cane at our surroundings. “
 it allegedly happened. As a member of the religious group that was allegedly persecuted. I'm still alive. And I tell you, firmly, 
”
I bit my lip, watching children dutifully recite the pledge of allegiance, hands at their hearts. 
“There are photographs.”
“Easily faked. Hire actors. Use Photoshop. It's easy. There are also very few. Maybe 100 total, reposted every time someone wants to make a political point.”
“They say the state censored evidence,” I countered. “There were more photographs, but they were expunged from the historical record.”
“Hogwash,” he spat. “When the radicals took power, they falsified documents to demonize their forebears.”
“There were internment camps...”
He sighed. “They were for our own good. We learned how backwards it was to worship some mystical sky-man that'd cast us into eternal hellfire if we ate improperly-butchered meat. The reason there're barely any religious adherents today is because we embraced modernity, not because the state murdered us.”
I nodded, unsure how to proceed. 
“And now, thanks to Eidetech,” he continued, casting his gaze into the classroom, “There's proof.”
Eidetech. An experimental service that allowed elderly people to upload memories to a server to preserve them for future generations.
“You can access any of my memories, any time, and see for yourself.”
So here we were. Observing a perfectly normal classroom full of bright-eyed-and-bushy-tailed ten-year-olds. In an internment camp for religious re-education. 115 years ago.
I opened my briefcase.
“Hackers leaked your health records to the press,” I said, dropping them on the desk. “They indicate a family history of Alzheimer's disease.”
He didn't react.
“Do you actually remember this? Or just trust the memories Eidetech provides?”
He smirked. “Why would Eidetech create 
 memories?”
“Maybe they're bigots.”
He shrugged. “Look – I'm the last person to see the internment camps. This is how I remember them. If we can't trust our own memories, what can we believe?”
I had no answer.
“But even if you're right... isn't this a more pleasant past than what they teach in school?”
I recalled the historical photographs. Hollow faces peeking from behind chainlink fences. Piled corpses, fresh from the incinerator, smoking in the snowbanks.
We watched sunbeams filter through the windowpane. Children happily stacked blocks and carefully coloured at their desks. It 
 pleasant.
“Maybe... there was no genocide,” I conceded.So... By the time i was a teen i was used to seeing the paranormal, especially while alone. But there were a few times i experienced things while with others. This is one account.
One summer my step sister was staying with us. We loved to sit in the back of my mother's townhouse. From the back porch we could see a small patch of trees and houses in front of us and to our side there was a drainage reservoir that was fenced in to keep kids out. And beyond that there was a small patch of a wooded  area. 
We would sit back there for hours just talking and laughing. One day on the concrete tunnel that separated the reservoir from the wooded area sat a teen boy about our age. He sat there as to just enjoy the day. After a few minutes of us looking over and gaining his attention he stood up. Red cap, white shirt, red shorts, and white shoes. As he walked to the corner of the fence we kinda laughed n realized he was looking our way as to come up to us. As he rounded the fence to come our way......he disappeared. We went up to our room n stayed there the rest of the night.
I guess the rumors about a teen boy hanging himself in that wooded area, were true.I don’t know why I wake up with the same idea again and again. Like a cosset tape that keeps getting flipped, but always on side B. Maybe it is a dream that I keep having, however, no matter how much I try to remember I see nothing but a black canvas appears in my mind. I’m not sure why I can’t relive myself from this idea. Like somehow it is the thing that defines who I am for the day, and the next one after. Recursion, a trapped loop without a break in sight. I can’t help it, the idea consumes me, stalking me at every thought. Oh, how I beg for some release. Like I should know it is not possible, it is untruthful, but the idea sinks deep into my veins.
Escaping the idea is useless. I tend to my day, eating cereal on my small dining room table. Watching the flakes of cereal float and contort onto themselves. What makes a single flake follow the lead of my spoon. Why do some decide to float away, while others benevolently fall into the spoon. Are some flakes of cereal inherently ready to die?
This sweet moment of freedom gets flush away once again by the idea. Why can’t I get pass the idea… Again, it is back, even when I’m trying to consume a simple meal. Again, it is back, even when I squeeze on my tie so tight, begging it to free me from my own conscious. Again, it is back, when I’m trying to slide my neatly ordered reports into my leather briefcase. Again, again, and again. I want some sweet escape from this idea once again.
The boring day in a cubical. The walls blank with fears, of nothing to hang but failed dreams. Wait, do I even still have dreams. What is the idea. Spreadsheet, two plus two equals four, no… 2+2=4… No, one plus three equals four. Wrong again, three plus one equals four. What am I doing, trying to hide this idea again. Hide the reality that I can not escape this idea again. Why do I keep this idea when I could just forget it, leave it all behind. But I continue, zero plus four is four.
I’m not crazy, I talk normal, I act normal, and I eat normal. The odd thing is that I can’t help but giggle. People talk around me, eating and nibbling on their mom’s mac and cheese. I wounder if they have the idea. Maybe they have a different idea. What if I’m the only one with this idea? The grins that I show, while sharing a fake story to hide my idea. Why would I share this idea with anyone? It is my idea, even if they asked. It is mine — my idea.
I don’t want to go back to sleep, I’ll just have the idea again and the idea will have me. I just don’t want this idea anymore. Sure it is my idea. But the same idea again and again. How am I not mad? I mean I know I am not. I can’t be mad, maybe angry. What is with the dream. The dark canvas. You can’t paint on a place where light does not exist. So, again, why do I have this idea. Why do I burden myself with this idea. My idea.
Author note: I do suffer in grammar, however, I am trying to improve. If you do see any syntactically malformed sentences, then please let me know. Hope you enjoyed.One day i was going through YouTube and i watched a video about the channel 666. well i wanted to check it out because i thaught it was fake. i typed out ''666'' and there came the reasults of what i tpued out. i clicked on the first thing that was there and the screen of my computer became all red. it kinda looked like blood. well i obviously tried to get outta that site but whenever i pressed back it didn't work. i accedently pressed a video. it was about a teenager girl. she lookrd like she was 15 years old. she was smiling at the start of the video but then she picked up a big knife. she was showing it to the camera. she then started to cut her right cheek off! i tried to stop the video cause it looked disgusting. but it didn't work. she cut her cheek off! she then started cutting off her left cheek. i was so disgusted. i didn't know what to do. after she cut it of she fainted. the computer just froze. i was so damn lucky it froze...At first, we thought the black liquid was oil, that we'd struck it rich and that we'd be able to retire and live in leisure.
We actually started writing down all the ways we'd spend the money.
Our first choice was to spend until we had our dreams. Houses, cars, pets, food... We'd spend as much as we wanted to spend, and we'd be happy.
Of course, we'd probably run out of money soon after.
Our second choice was to spend mostly on the necessities, only indulging on luxuries when we were sure we were stable.
Sadly, our dreams were cut short as we dug deeper, and realized that we hadn't hit oil.
Whatever it was, its eyes were gleaming as it started to rise from the ground.She opens the door and is immediately hit with the smell of jammed printer and paranoia. 
It is burning hot and just-hidden under speckled skin and bone, wire-thin fingers depressing the small character-inscribed squares of the portable computer keyboard; same characters appearing on the white screen of the number-cruncher (this time not numbers, records - have to write it down in case she can't remember. It only makes sense, understandable) lights dimmed, (lightbulbs old – have to be replaced) and the hands hitting the machine trembling; machine growling, lights blinking, paper snarled and scribbled over with more characters (what do they say) in blueness. Extension cords on the floor (fire hazard – the floor should be free and clear in case they come, have to leave quickly), rug bunched up under the chair legs (will wrinkle, in time that may not); trash on the floor, filthy, burn smell. The locks are not strong enough, the windows too open behind the thin cardboard and curtains. The hands curl, fists ready to fight, have to fight (outmatched most likely, can't fight well or long enough, no weapons), someone is here and they will find out, they will read and pry head open to find questions being asked. Nails bite
She is the one at the table, typing.
The door is out of reach (twenty feet) and there is nobody (only the one here – at the doorway too but not right now, this now) reading these letters. No wind at the windows, shored; locks intact and fastened, none broken or picked. Lights off to reduce electricity consumption and pretend inactivity (somewhere it is morning, early early morning – not many are up this early, can arise suspicion). Safe. Extension cords bundled (neat and tidy – easily moved and stepped over) and tucked against intact whitewashed wall. Only one in the room this now; others walk in different now but not interacting with her. Clutter under control (no control – randomness is key, observation ties down) printer under control, jam fixed; lightbulbs florescent, lasting years more (fifty – cracks deteriorate, leak. No cracks mean seventy). All from another now, distant; palms whole, hands type locations likelihoods observations 
She is not in the room and the printer is broken, paranoia smelling like burnt toast.There was a moment of hesitation, and the radio crackled to life. A soft voice struggled not to drown in the rain Diane saw rushing past her window. She parted her lips, whispering steam onto the glass: “Do you hear me?” Beyond, the world glowed with the promise of a never-ending night, a vibrance she’d grown to long for in the quiet void between the trees. She looked up into the abyss and forced herself to focus instead on the soothing buzz beside her. “…to remain the same through the end of the week. That means it’s as good a time as any to fix that hole in your roof before you awake in a indoor pool”. Diane smiled. She wished she could reciprocate, express her gratitude to that for which she’d grown a feverish desire. She sighed away the ache, looking deep into the forest until the radio once more sang static, and she found herself alone again. She did not remember.All four men knew that their annual getaway trip happened the weekend after Thanksgiving. 
All four men knew to set aside those three days, the three days that followed the holiday, for their own sort of tradition, their own sort of holiday.
All four men were married with children and had demanding jobs, so they found the trip a necessary repose - from life and wife and strife and child - to relax and reconnect. To be guys. 
But the four men had gotten bad about the “annual” part and 5 years passed without one. So this year, it had been decided: they’d get back to it. 
Sam Waterson was cool like California, with tattoos and a beard, and he worked with children, specialized therapy…for those special kids with sensory issues. 
Jack Fowler was sturdy like Montana, a real-life rancher who lived on a sprawling mass of open land with his lovely, homely wife…empty nesters since the kids flew the coop. 
Tommy Jutland was rough like Tennessee, where he worked on cars that were too far-gone in his backyard, gasoline and motor oil always under his fingernails. 
And Camden Sellers was clean-cut like Maine. He managed a hedge fund in the city and made startlingly too much money for the startlingly little amount of work he did. 
Per tradition, they booked the same shitty room at the same shitty motel, a real gaunt roadside pull off out West, simply called MOTEL. Or, really, just M-T-L, because the other letters on the neon sign had burned out. 
Sam Waterson would arrive first and smile. 
Jack Fowler would arrive next and say “Big guy. Hey.” 
Tommy Jutland blew in then, beer in hand, saying “Missed you bastards, mean it” 
And Camden Sellers arrived last, after a delayed flight, calling the weekend to order, remarking how 5 years had passed so quickly.  
Nine days later, when police raided the motel room, they would find a scene of “bizarre devastation”, per the Sheriff’s report. “Bizarre” because one of the beds was missing, nowhere to be found. The floor where it had been was destroyed, by what the Sheriff guessed was an axe (though no weapon had even been recovered) and a large crude hole remained. 
It was from this hole, that the police recovered all of the bodies.  
An alarming amount of narcotics – meth, marijuana, cocaine, fourteen types of prescription medication- were found, littering the space. 
DNA forensics further revealed that the arms of victim 1 had been removed and attached to victim 2 while the legs of victim 3 were attached to the body of victim 4. 
However, they couldn’t figure out exactly how. 
No blood could be collected from the crime scene. The coroner had ruled out stitches, sutures, or any other standard forms of surgical attachment. 
The most baffling question to authorities however, was why the body of the fifth victim appeared, forensically, to be about 5 years further into decomposition than the other four. Sticks and leaves are much too brittle to hold a man my size. If I was being smart, I might have watched where I was going and avoided the hole entirely. Instead, my attention was on my hiking partner. Her jokes and charming demeanor kept be engaged and lively on the trail, but they also made me miss the pit beneath the foliage.
A 15-foot drop isn’t too bad if you see it coming, but it will mess you up if you don’t. Only one of my legs felt broken but the other had lodged itself into a crevice big enough to enter but not big enough to leave. I was stuck. My partner tried to reach me, but the walls of the hole were too slick with moss and the drop too tall to risk climbing down. She ran off to get help leaving me alone in the ditch to fend for myself.
After only a moment, my broken leg already throbbed and my back had begun to twinge from my awkward positioning. I figured the situation was as bad as it could get.
Then I heard the Crick Crack sound. Quiet at first, but gradually getting more prominent as the seconds ticked past.
It started near my feet. Crick, Crack, Crick, Crack.
I felt something slimy on the ankle of my trapped leg. Then on the bleeding calf of the broken one. It inched slowly up my pants leg, leaving a trail of wetness behind it. My body shivered and my skin ran cold.
The sound got louder. Crick, Crack, Crick, Crack. I felt more crawling on the crotch of my pants. Any part of my body that was touching the stones suddenly was overcome with something. Something that made a Crick Crack noise and felt slimy.
Panic overcame me. I tried to brush at the places where I felt it. My hands met small, hard shells and gelatinous bodies. Hundreds of them.
It was the snail’s shells rubbing together that made the noise. No matter how much I tried to brush them off, there were just too many. They engulfed my lower body and inched their way up to my torso. Their assent was slow and maddening. I felt their little eyeball stalks brush against my bare skin as they crawled up my pants legs and underneath my shirt. Crick, Crack, Crick Crack.
Their wet trails had begun to burn ever so slightly as they reached my neck. All I could do was whimper. My friend had still not yet returned and I feared she wouldn’t be able to find me in the dark. I called out for her as the snails began to reach my chin.
They’ve covered me. From my ankles to my eyeballs. 
I hear my friend calling for me from above. But I don’t want them in my mouth. I dare not scream.
There’s only one noise coming that will come from my lips.
Crick, Crack, Crick Crack.Her name was Elizabeth, and she loved asylums. Ever since age 3 she was downright OBSESSED with them. Just the thought of being in an asylum with countless crazies roaming around her, screaming, laughing and crying made her ecstatic.
For years she had been begging her parents to arrange for her to stay a night at the local madhouse, St Kay's Wellness Center, but no matter what she said nor what she did got them to budge. The answer was clearly no. Now, Elizabeth had just turned 18 and she saw this as an opportunity to finally get what she wanted. As a legal adult, she could just call the center and request an empty room for the night, but it would be pretty difficult since she wasn't allowed to use the phone. She sighed and decided to go find her dad. Couldn't hurt to ask one more time.
"Hey daddy! Can I use the phone?" Elizabeth said as she pressed her face to the bars and smiled, a wide, wide smile.
The man looked slightly annoyed. "I'm not your dad, Kenzi. How many times I gotta tell you that?"
Elizabeth's eyes narrowed. "My name. Is not. KENZI!" She snarled, bits of spittle flying out of her mouth and hitting the guard.
Matt brushed his shirt off and stood up. He didn't even bother with an answer. She had been coming up to him with the same question several times a day for 14 years ever since she turned 18.
He walked out of the room.“Save me the merrythought,” I remember my great-nana saying that Thanksgiving evening as my father carved the turkey. She explained that was what they used to call the wishbone, and how long before our modern tradition of simply breaking it and making a wish, they were used to predict the severity of the coming winter. “Kinda like the groundhog,” I remember thinking. Wars were even fought based on its divination. “If we stay up late enough,” she’d said, “I’ll tell you of the coming winter.” I couldn’t wait to hear more.
The rest of the family was long asleep when she turned out the lights and lit the candles. She held the wishbone up to the small flame and examined it, rolling it over in her worn hands, her veins bulging like a winding, frozen river. I remember the candle light dancing in the reflection of her thick bifocals, and the look of shock in her foggy eyes when she stopped spinning the wishbone. I remember the slight gasp and guttural sounds she made as she shook, just before she and the wishbone dropped. I remember being paralyzed and waiting, too long, to see if this was part of nana’s ritual; for her frail form to move, for her head and wiry, gray hair to raise from the table and tell me what she saw.
The family was already gathered together, so we had the funeral only a couple of days later. Black dresses and coattails stewed in the chilly wind. Everyone kept saying she’d had a good, long life, that at least she got to enjoy the holiday, and see the family together before it happened. They all kept asking me how I was doing, not just because of my age, but since I was there. I quietly nodded but could not stop thinking about my nana and how afraid she’d seemed at the end; how she appeared to be trying with all her might to get just one last word to me before surrendering to her fate. And as I wondered, with each passing hour, the temperature dropped.
Only a few days later, winter came. And it has been ever since.
They mutter to themselves and each other, “how could this have happened? How could we not have seen this coming?” I’m the only one who reminds them, as we huddle together and listen to our stomachs growl, that at least one person saw it coming. I’m the only one who ever says, “don’t forget the wishbone.”
I was just a kid then, but I still remember her voice, gentle and inviting like that tiny flame. 
What I can’t remember is what it feels like to be warm, or the taste of turkey.There's a man in a room, in a dark, dark house, who breathes no air yet lives.
He's a tired man, a weary man, a man whose eyes want to close but can't. He reads the pages of a book, a very old book, and the lights are dim and the room is dark so he can barely see the words, the words written in faded, faded ink. But he tries. He's been trying to read the ink for the entire night, the dark dark night – the words burn his tired, tired eyes and say things that are hard to understand. The words say things that are best left for dark, dark nights.
The words say things that the man has heard before, in a different room, in a different house. The words say things that steal what can't be stolen and trick them into believing that they're still there. The words say things that greedy-suck at the light and air with open mouths.
In the dark, the man reads the old, old book and tries to find out what the words took from him in that different room in that different house. He needs to find what's missing because he can feel the hole it left – his insides stretch and churn around the empty space and it hurts, it hurts him. 
It hurts when he has to breathe and can't – he doesn't breathe. It hurts less that way, when he doesn't breathe in the dark, dark room. He doesn't breathe the dust on the old, old book and feel it poison him from within. 
The man sits and reads, not breathing, not breathing, until the dark dark house is light again. He is alive another day and the words still say nothing, nothing he can understand.I am here at the Thanksgiving table surrounded by my family. My mom, my dad, my little brother named Tim and I had just finished eating the turkey my mom cooked for all of us. When she put it on the table we said our prayers then we feasted on the turkey and everything else on the table. While we were eating, my mom and dad were having a conversation about stuff like our president and stuff on TV. I started conversations too with them since I wanted something to do while eating. After I was done eating I took the time to look around at each of my family members thinking of how glad I am to have each of them. I looked at my caring mother who stays at home to care and cook for me and my brother. Then I looked at my father who works hard to make sure we have a roof over our heads and food on the table. Then I looked at my brother who I kinda forgot was here since he was so quiet. He looked down on the floor and I can see his face a little to notice that he looked disappointed.
"What's wrong Tim" I asked. 
Tim looked up to meet my gaze. My mom and dad stopped talking and looked at Tim. They must have forgotten he was here as well and they wanted to know what was wrong. 
"Oh it's nothing" He said.
"What's wrong honey, didn't you like mommy's turkey she cooked for us?" My mom asked with a caring voice.
"No it's not that it's just..." He stopped.
"What?" I asked curiously.
"Well...I wanted the turkey to be alive when we ate it".November 24, 2016:
The night sky was full of lights. My aunt was falling asleep in her chair, only to be awoken by a grasshopper that jumped onto her leg. She brushed it off. Some of the other kids were telling stories, but my eyes were stuck on the sky. In a way, it was beautiful. In another way, it was horrifying.
My parents were in a hospital a few hours away. Their bones were beginning to be eroded at a rapid pace, so they couldn't walk anymore. They've both had to get artificial ribs to prevent any damage to their torso, since the bones frequently fractured without warning, causing massive internal bleeding. Once the spinal column began to degrade, there was nothing that could be done for them. We called it "Bone Mush".
In the distance, a large beam of light hit the ground. The town below it was evaporated instantly, creating a shockwave that went on for at least hundreds of miles. I don't think any of us bothered to care anymore. Suddenly the radio switched from "America's top 100 Classics" to the news.
"The exchange is going well. The UN has called upon the top medical and scientific authorities on Earth to help discuss matters involving the future relationship between humans and 'The Blue Ones'. So far, we've agreed to allow for them to do as they wish, however due to their technological superiority, there is not much of an option. In other news, the Bone Mush outbreak is now affecting around one tenth of the world's population. No treatment or cure has been tested yet, much less found. We hope The Blue Ones may help us deal with this sudden, unprecedented disease."
The radio began playing "Ring of Fire", by Johnny Cash. The radio was mocking us; it was pretty cold outside. This chill was further elevated when the fire caught the worst of the breeze and died out. The coals remaining were glowing.
I was the only one here watching the sky. No one else seemed to care that at any moment we could be turned into dust. The Blue Ones are not our friends! They don't care about humans, they care about taking Earth. No matter how hard we try there is nothing we can do to stop them. Our entire speciesis going to be destroyed and they won't even remember us. They'll just think about how great it was to visit Earth for the first time and have humans help them around. Happy Thanksgiving, visitors.It's nights like these that keep me busy. I mostly deal with the elderly, the homeless, the inebriated, the occasional teenager or two, and far more children than I'd like. Naturally, there are those that are none of the above thrown into the mix, but those are few and far between. Can't say the same about my coworkers' clientele, though.
I don't particularly enjoy meeting those I've been assigned: they're always ashen and shaking once they sense my presence, shaking that leads to bewildered eyes and stiff joints. But a job's a job and given my condition, I don't have the privilege to be picky. None of us do, really.
I try to assure them that it'll be alright – I understand what they're going through far too well – but they never seem to listen until my job is done. It's a shame since it would spare both of us the trouble if they'd just pay attention, but I know focusing can be difficult when I'm around. Oh, how I know.
On extremely rare occasions, one of my assignments will be cancelled by a higher -up for reasons never explained. It can be a bit frustrating when I've been spending hours on a particular case, but I don't mind, in the end. Less of the messy work for me to deal with, as the actual completion of an assignment can be...an ordeal, at times. Most of them are fairly straightforward, but some of my clients are not nearly as cooperative. That, of course, can be easily remedied, but I prefer to let them have their freedom while it lasts.
It's nights like these that keep me busy. Better keep your coat on, or I'll be there for you next.He knew by the paunch. 
He had always told himself that when there was a paunch around his waist - as there was now- that it'd be time to accept that he had, in fact, entered Midlife. 
And Midlife meant that soon, a crisis was to accompany. Inevitable. 
All his life, he had been so diligent about staying in shape. 
He ate healthy. 
He moisturized. 
He dressed well. 
Suits. 
Ties. 
Cole Haan. 
His wife appreciated it and let him know, kissing him each night and saying "Love you, Handsome". His daughter's little girlfriends giggled nervously  around him, like little Electras, and he'd act like he didn't notice. 
The guys at work envied him, too - though they'd never admit it-for his handsomeness. 
For his build. 
For his presence. 
He was the suit and tie, the silver hair, you'd see and envy. 
A real good man. 
A real good man...with a paunch. 
And that extra fat, that extra skin, that paunch, worked wonders against his self-confidence.
He felt ugly.
He felt weak. 
And he hated feeling weak. 
So he decided it was time to live his life. 
Live with a capital L Live. 
Live by doing whatever he wanted. 
Live like traveling. 
Live like enjoying a nice meal. 
Live like learning a new language. 
That was it. 
Throw worry to the wind and Live. 
So every day, instead of going to lunch, he'd pop in the repetitive tape- he had decided on Thai- and soon he was confident in his abilities, speaking it around the house. His wife appreciated it and was impressed- "look at you!" she'd say, impressed. And his daughter's little girlfriends giggled nervously  around him, hearing a towering silver-haired daddy of a man speak such a foreign tongue. 
But he had to to do it. 
Because when he got to Thailand, it'd make things so much easier. 
Because when he got to Thailand, he could say "under 13" and they'd know what he meant. 
Because when he got to Thailand, he could say, "I don't care how much" and they'd understand him. 
Because when he got to Thailand, the little girl he purchased, wouldn't care about the paunch. “Please, everyone, put your hands together for prayer.” Everyone complied, and we fell silent as Father began.
“Firstly, we must be thankful that God has provided us with such a bountiful feast, and that we are all together for this heartwarming occasion.” 
“We have been luckier than most, and we should be glad that we have not lost any of those who matter to us.” 
“Let us take a moment of silence for the McMillers, who have lost their eldest son and youngest daughter to the Freeze.” I involuntarily glance outside, at the living ice flying about the air, its cold heart consuming the poor souls who wander inside its body. I’ve always hated the Freeze.
“This year, we will skip taking turns and giving our thanks, for I believe we are thankful for the same things. Being inside, safe and warm from the Freeze,” True. “Having family and feast alike to weather the raging storm outside,” Kinda. “And resting peacefully, knowing all the nonbelievers in our great God have received punishment this year.” 
 “With that, I conclude prayer. Enjoy your meal, everyone.”
My stomach reeling, I glance at this year’s “turkey.” Apparently poor Anne wasn’t religious enough.Not a normal girl. 
Even though she mostly acted like one. 
Kitten ears, a cat tail, sharp teeth. 
Of course, she looked up to you. 
Must be the reason why she called you, “Master”. 
Unknowingly, you left the front door unlocked when you went to work this morning. 
Somebody got in. 
Ultimately, you came home later than expected. 
Master adoration sparkles in her eyes. 
Even though they lie on the carpet.So yah today I saw a Djinn. The weird thing about this all is I live in Connecticut, so I mean as far as I'm concerned I shouldn't really have to worry about this kind of thing. So today I went to my Aunt's house for thanksgiving and when we got home my little sister needed to go to her friends house to pick up her shirt she left there and for whatever reason both of my parents went. I am a senior in high school so I was outside playing basketball by myself as it became dark, I then noticed something weird. Let me explain my surroundings. My house is on the "main road" of our town about 15 feet above the road on a hill, across the street is a much bigger hill with more houses. Okay I was playing basketball and I looked up on top of the hill across the street and there was a figure, maybe a little taller then a normal human being standing there, arms at it's side, looking at me. Rather staring actually. Or I guess it was because the eyes on this things were so bright I had to turn away almost immediately. They were white and then yellow and back to white every few seconds. I was now squinting to get a better look at it when it became even brighter. At this point I couldn't even look in it's direction. Ya know when u stare at lights and you can see the beems of light coming off of them? Well the beems were all I could see and I was looking 90 degrees away from it in a completely different direction. I ended up running away and by the time I got the balls to look back it's direction it wasn't there. As far as I know that's what a Djinn looks like. Anyone have any ideas as to what it might be?Still hung over from all the sugar rush of candy from Halloween? Me too! Let's forget about candy for a while...

Questions? Comments? Gravy Jokes? Leave'em below!Anna hated stubble. There wasn't a feeling in the world that annoyed her like the feeling of hairs on her legs. She shaved daily, trying to prevent those little spots, but they kept growing, and growing. Waxing didn't help long enough, lasers weren't reliable yet, she had tried every miracle product and none worked, so she shaved. 
She'd spent the last hour trying to get to the root of the problem. The blades scraped untill they were blunt, but she just kept seeing those damn hairs. It was maddening. Tired and slightly lightheaded, she took a break to check on her progress.
A smile spread across Anna's face. She laughed happily as she put a new razor blade on her leg. Almost there. After all, her problem was only skin deep.Two days ago, my camera broke. Accidentally dropped it in a pool if you're wondering and I was going on holiday in a few weeks so I quickly needed a replacement. A new camera was too expensive so I had to resort to eBay to replace my ruined camera.
I browsed a few pages and noted a few good examples when I stumbled on a great deal, a camera exactly my own but it was being sold for a tenth of the price! The seller had a lot of positive feedback and the images showed that it was in perfect order so I quickly placed a bid and waited, two days later, the camera was mine.
I gave my address to the seller, gave the man his money and eagerly awaited my purchase. I soon received a simple brown package with a label showing my sending details and quickly opened it to see my new camera. I snapped a few shots and it was as he said, but before I was finished, I decided to check the SD card.
I plugged it into my crappy $600 laptop and saw there was one folder labeled "PICTURES", I opened it to see seven pictures unimaginatively labeled 001, 002, 003 etc. I clicked on 001 to see a shipping label, a bit weird but nothing more. The next picture left me trembling. It was a corpse. A freshly murdered 
. I quickly went to the next picture to see what was next. It was another shipping label, I knew what was next but was still sick when I saw it. It was like this until I reached 007. It was my shipping address.
That's why I'm writing this, I just heard knocking on my door. It hasn't stopped in 20 minutes and is only getting harder. I called 911 a quarter of an hour ago but they won't be here in time. Because I just heard my dining room window shatter.There once was a small forest nearby a small village that the locals called the Forest of Laughter. It was an attraction for many of the villager’s children, to go and spend their days playing in the forest ‘til the sunset, while the adults were working in the fields. It got that name, because sometimes, if the wind was right, and the ground was calm, you could hear the children’s laughter coming from those woods. The younglings were usually found playing in a naked small field, that was located in the middle of the forest, that the villagers referred to as the Oak Field. It was covered with a short moist grass, that always felt like it was coated in a morning dew and it stayed that way even on hottest of days. At the center of this field, there was an old, thick branched oak tree. It had many carvings of the children names on its trunk, some cuts were so deep, the sap from the oak never stopped bleeding, as the wounds were too deep to heal. The villagers, both young and old loved the forest, for what it provided to the little community.
On one of the sunsets, however, a villager’s daughter Gloria, an eight year old with a yellow dress didn't return from the forest as usual. When other kids, who came back from it, were asked by the worried father, if they've seen her, they all just shook their heads. The country men gathered the torches and began the search. The whole forest was searched, throughout the night and day, inch by inch, but the girl was never found.
Few days later, when the search was over, to the surprise of the villagers and the mourning father, little Gloria emerged from the woods right before the sunset. The strangest thing was that the girl was happy and laughing, as if nothing bad have happened. When asked where she was those past few days, she simply shrugged her shoulders and said: “I was just playing with the kids.”
Few days later, the daughter’s father decided to go into the forest alone, while the girl was sleeping at home. He took his torch and went into the woods just as the sunset light has scorched the sky with its reddish tint. As he reached the Oak Field, he noticed a small silhouette resting on the grass, it’s back leaned to the old Oak. Once he reached the silhouette, the light of torch revealed something that made the man paralyzed for a moment. It was a corpse of a little girl in a yellow dress. Above her head, on the Oak’s trunk there was a fresh carve, from which the sap continued to bleed out. It read “Gloria”. Once he read it, his horrified eyes stared back to the direction of the village as he silently asked himself: “Who is she?”
As the sun completely set, and the red sky turned black, you could hear the children's laughter from the forest as it took another prey.I'm always finding stray hairs all over the place. 
My apartment is covered in them. Some are in the usual places. On my pillow, on my bathroom counter, and in the drain of my shower. Others are in more weirder locations like in my refrigerator and on the ceiling fan. A few even end up in my mouth. I can't help but feel unnerved when I come across them. I shouldn't feel uncomfortable with finding stray hairs in my living space. 
An explanation is in order. I'm a woman, one who has a full head of hair and who likes to grow it out. My hair is thick and usually falls off on its own so, I should expect rogue strands. 
That being said, I shouldn't expect them to be short and black when I'm a brunette. 'Oh yes, we have a ghost,' your hostess says, as she leads you to your bedroom.
Of course the place would be haunted. The inn is ancient – more than 500 years old. But this was meant to be a relaxing holiday. 'Go somewhere quiet,' your doctor had told you. 'No surprises. Just somewhere to rest, in peace.' If only your car hadn't broken down, leaving you stuck out here all night.
'It's a bit boring really,' she continues, with a shrug. 'Nobody has ever never seen anything – just heard footsteps occasionally.' 
As your hostess bids you goodnight and closes the door, you fight against the urge to run to it and barricade yourself in. Instead, you make yourself walk to the door, lock it slowly, and then slowly and carefully go to the window and draw the curtains. As you lie down you take more deep breaths until your heartbeat slows and you feel calm again.
As you settle down under the covers you soon find yourself drifting off. Only to hear a sound coming from outside your door, in the corridor. Footsteps? No, not footsteps. don't be ridiculous. You are hearing things. Probably just a waking dream. You gradually drift back to sleep again. Only to hear – footsteps. Yes, definitely footsteps, and not from a guest. These are hollow, peculiar, and seem to come from the other end of time. Why are you frightening yourself like this? They make your hair stand on end. How could you have thought they were a dream? They have stopped. No, they will keep on coming. They will not stop. Your heart is hammering faster and faster. Please, stop! Your breath comes out in shuddering gasps, and you cannot stop it. The footsteps coming closer and closer, louder and louder until – suddenly, there is silence.
Now you are not afraid any more. In fact, you feel strangely lighthearted. What an idiot you were! To be actually afraid of a noise! A noise cannot hurt you. You laugh to yourself and turn over to go back to sleep, but strangely, considering how tired you were before, sleep eludes you. Instead, you sit up to see a very curious thing. Slowly, tendrils of mist are gathering at the end of your bed. You watch, entranced, as they form themselves into – a ghost! A whiskery old man, dressed in pantaloons, an old style coat and neckerchief, sitting on the end of your bed, looking at you. But you are not a bit scared. Instead you are just merely intrigued. You remember the story from earlier.
'What an odd thing,' you say, and your voice sounds hoarse in your ears. 'My hostess said nobody had ever seen the ghost.'
'Nobody living,' the ghost replies with a sinister grin. 'Your heart stopped beating five minutes ago.'Silently, I stood before the open casket, gazing down at my sister's face. "Bethany? Are you okay?" my father asked, his hand upon my shoulder. "I just...I can't believe she's gone." I whispered, my voice trembling. "If I hadn't lost touch with her-" "Oh, honey." my mother said, hugging me as I began to cry. "Don't blame yourself. Nobody knew Victoria was going to poison herself, even with the problems she had." Still, I feel bad." I said through sobs. "Even after the times she picked on me, I still loved her." "We know, dear." My father replied. "You've always been as sweet as Momma's pumpkin pie." "Thanks, Daddy." I said meekly. "Do you want to ride home with us?" my mother then asked. "Thanks, Momma, but I'm not quite ready to leave Vicki just yet. Besides, I got Patrick here with me." "Okay, darlin',  we'll see you at the house then." "Okay." I said. They both then gave me a sad smile before leaving me alone with my sister's corpse.

  Once I was sure they were gone, I wiped the tears away and rolled my eyes in disgust. "That was quite the performance, sugar." Patrick said as he entered the room. "Why, thank you." I replied before he pulled me in for a kiss. "Sweet as Momma's pumpkin pie, like Daddy always says. Though not as sweet as candy yams drizzled with antifreeze. One would've thought she drank too much wine the way it affected her." "That's for sure." he replied, wrapping his arms around me. "Deep down, I always preferred my pumpkin pie with a bit more spice." He then grinned mischievously, making my heart skip a beat. "God, I love you, Mr. Mason." "And I love you, Mrs. Mason." Mrs. Mason. The sound of it filled me with joy. I was finally in the spotlight. I then took one last look at my twin's face. "Sweet dreams, Beth." I giggled as I closed the casket's lid.He was crotchety, irritable – the skin on his face more like melted candle-wax than human flesh – but for an 125-year-old, he was surprisingly alert.
I carefully considered how to begin the conversation, while children, unperturbed by our presence, milled about the classroom.
“Today, I'm meeting with the last living person to have directly witnessed the religious genocide 115 years ago...”
I hadn't even completed my introduction before he interjected. “There was no genocide.”
“I understand that's your position...”
“I was here, 
 it allegedly happened,” he said, swirling his cane at our surroundings. “
 it allegedly happened. As a member of the religious group that was allegedly persecuted. I'm still alive. And I tell you, firmly, 
”
I bit my lip, watching children dutifully recite the pledge of allegiance, hands at their hearts. 
“There are photographs.”
“Easily faked. Hire actors. Use Photoshop. It's easy. There are also very few. Maybe 100 total, reposted every time someone wants to make a political point.”
“They say the state censored evidence,” I countered. “There were more photographs, but they were expunged from the historical record.”
“Hogwash,” he spat. “When the radicals took power, they falsified documents to demonize their forebears.”
“There were internment camps...”
He sighed. “They were for our own good. We learned how backwards it was to worship some mystical sky-man that'd cast us into eternal hellfire if we ate improperly-butchered meat. The reason there're barely any religious adherents today is because we embraced modernity, not because the state murdered us.”
I nodded, unsure how to proceed. 
“And now, thanks to Eidetech,” he continued, casting his gaze into the classroom, “There's proof.”
Eidetech. An experimental service that allowed elderly people to upload memories to a server to preserve them for future generations.
“You can access any of my memories, any time, and see for yourself.”
So here we were. Observing a perfectly normal classroom full of bright-eyed-and-bushy-tailed ten-year-olds. In an internment camp for religious re-education. 115 years ago.
I opened my briefcase.
“Hackers leaked your health records to the press,” I said, dropping them on the desk. “They indicate a family history of Alzheimer's disease.”
He didn't react.
“Do you actually remember this? Or just trust the memories Eidetech provides?”
He smirked. “Why would Eidetech create 
 memories?”
“Maybe they're bigots.”
He shrugged. “Look – I'm the last person to see the internment camps. This is how I remember them. If we can't trust our own memories, what can we believe?”
I had no answer.
“But even if you're right... isn't this a more pleasant past than what they teach in school?”
I recalled the historical photographs. Hollow faces peeking from behind chainlink fences. Piled corpses, fresh from the incinerator, smoking in the snowbanks.
We watched sunbeams filter through the windowpane. Children happily stacked blocks and carefully coloured at their desks. It 
 pleasant.
“Maybe... there was no genocide,” I conceded.So... By the time i was a teen i was used to seeing the paranormal, especially while alone. But there were a few times i experienced things while with others. This is one account.
One summer my step sister was staying with us. We loved to sit in the back of my mother's townhouse. From the back porch we could see a small patch of trees and houses in front of us and to our side there was a drainage reservoir that was fenced in to keep kids out. And beyond that there was a small patch of a wooded  area. 
We would sit back there for hours just talking and laughing. One day on the concrete tunnel that separated the reservoir from the wooded area sat a teen boy about our age. He sat there as to just enjoy the day. After a few minutes of us looking over and gaining his attention he stood up. Red cap, white shirt, red shorts, and white shoes. As he walked to the corner of the fence we kinda laughed n realized he was looking our way as to come up to us. As he rounded the fence to come our way......he disappeared. We went up to our room n stayed there the rest of the night.
I guess the rumors about a teen boy hanging himself in that wooded area, were true.I don’t know why I wake up with the same idea again and again. Like a cosset tape that keeps getting flipped, but always on side B. Maybe it is a dream that I keep having, however, no matter how much I try to remember I see nothing but a black canvas appears in my mind. I’m not sure why I can’t relive myself from this idea. Like somehow it is the thing that defines who I am for the day, and the next one after. Recursion, a trapped loop without a break in sight. I can’t help it, the idea consumes me, stalking me at every thought. Oh, how I beg for some release. Like I should know it is not possible, it is untruthful, but the idea sinks deep into my veins.
Escaping the idea is useless. I tend to my day, eating cereal on my small dining room table. Watching the flakes of cereal float and contort onto themselves. What makes a single flake follow the lead of my spoon. Why do some decide to float away, while others benevolently fall into the spoon. Are some flakes of cereal inherently ready to die?
This sweet moment of freedom gets flush away once again by the idea. Why can’t I get pass the idea… Again, it is back, even when I’m trying to consume a simple meal. Again, it is back, even when I squeeze on my tie so tight, begging it to free me from my own conscious. Again, it is back, when I’m trying to slide my neatly ordered reports into my leather briefcase. Again, again, and again. I want some sweet escape from this idea once again.
The boring day in a cubical. The walls blank with fears, of nothing to hang but failed dreams. Wait, do I even still have dreams. What is the idea. Spreadsheet, two plus two equals four, no… 2+2=4… No, one plus three equals four. Wrong again, three plus one equals four. What am I doing, trying to hide this idea again. Hide the reality that I can not escape this idea again. Why do I keep this idea when I could just forget it, leave it all behind. But I continue, zero plus four is four.
I’m not crazy, I talk normal, I act normal, and I eat normal. The odd thing is that I can’t help but giggle. People talk around me, eating and nibbling on their mom’s mac and cheese. I wounder if they have the idea. Maybe they have a different idea. What if I’m the only one with this idea? The grins that I show, while sharing a fake story to hide my idea. Why would I share this idea with anyone? It is my idea, even if they asked. It is mine — my idea.
I don’t want to go back to sleep, I’ll just have the idea again and the idea will have me. I just don’t want this idea anymore. Sure it is my idea. But the same idea again and again. How am I not mad? I mean I know I am not. I can’t be mad, maybe angry. What is with the dream. The dark canvas. You can’t paint on a place where light does not exist. So, again, why do I have this idea. Why do I burden myself with this idea. My idea.

Hope you enjoyed.One day i was going through YouTube and i watched a video about the channel 666. well i wanted to check it out because i thaught it was fake. i typed out ''666'' and there came the reasults of what i tpued out. i clicked on the first thing that was there and the screen of my computer became all red. it kinda looked like blood. well i obviously tried to get outta that site but whenever i pressed back it didn't work. i accedently pressed a video. it was about a teenager girl. she lookrd like she was 15 years old. she was smiling at the start of the video but then she picked up a big knife. she was showing it to the camera. she then started to cut her right cheek off! i tried to stop the video cause it looked disgusting. but it didn't work. she cut her cheek off! she then started cutting off her left cheek. i was so disgusted. i didn't know what to do. after she cut it of she fainted. the computer just froze. i was so damn lucky it froze...At first, we thought the black liquid was oil, that we'd struck it rich and that we'd be able to retire and live in leisure.
We actually started writing down all the ways we'd spend the money.
Our first choice was to spend until we had our dreams. Houses, cars, pets, food... We'd spend as much as we wanted to spend, and we'd be happy.
Of course, we'd probably run out of money soon after.
Our second choice was to spend mostly on the necessities, only indulging on luxuries when we were sure we were stable.
Sadly, our dreams were cut short as we dug deeper, and realized that we hadn't hit oil.
Whatever it was, its eyes were gleaming as it started to rise from the ground.She opens the door and is immediately hit with the smell of jammed printer and paranoia. 
It is burning hot and just-hidden under speckled skin and bone, wire-thin fingers depressing the small character-inscribed squares of the portable computer keyboard; same characters appearing on the white screen of the number-cruncher (this time not numbers, records - have to write it down in case she can't remember. It only makes sense, understandable) lights dimmed, (lightbulbs old – have to be replaced) and the hands hitting the machine trembling; machine growling, lights blinking, paper snarled and scribbled over with more characters (what do they say) in blueness. Extension cords on the floor (fire hazard – the floor should be free and clear in case they come, have to leave quickly), rug bunched up under the chair legs (will wrinkle, in time that may not); trash on the floor, filthy, burn smell. The locks are not strong enough, the windows too open behind the thin cardboard and curtains. The hands curl, fists ready to fight, have to fight (outmatched most likely, can't fight well or long enough, no weapons), someone is here and they will find out, they will read and pry head open to find questions being asked. Nails bite
She is the one at the table, typing.
The door is out of reach (twenty feet) and there is nobody (only the one here – at the doorway too but not right now, this now) reading these letters. No wind at the windows, shored; locks intact and fastened, none broken or picked. Lights off to reduce electricity consumption and pretend inactivity (somewhere it is morning, early early morning – not many are up this early, can arise suspicion). Safe. Extension cords bundled (neat and tidy – easily moved and stepped over) and tucked against intact whitewashed wall. Only one in the room this now; others walk in different now but not interacting with her. Clutter under control (no control – randomness is key, observation ties down) printer under control, jam fixed; lightbulbs florescent, lasting years more (fifty – cracks deteriorate, leak. No cracks mean seventy). All from another now, distant; palms whole, hands type locations likelihoods observations 
She is not in the room and the printer is broken, paranoia smelling like burnt toast.There was a moment of hesitation, and the radio crackled to life. A soft voice struggled not to drown in the rain Diane saw rushing past her window. She parted her lips, whispering steam onto the glass: “Do you hear me?” Beyond, the world glowed with the promise of a never-ending night, a vibrance she’d grown to long for in the quiet void between the trees. She looked up into the abyss and forced herself to focus instead on the soothing buzz beside her. “…to remain the same through the end of the week. That means it’s as good a time as any to fix that hole in your roof before you awake in a indoor pool”. Diane smiled. She wished she could reciprocate, express her gratitude to that for which she’d grown a feverish desire. She sighed away the ache, looking deep into the forest until the radio once more sang static, and she found herself alone again. She did not remember.All four men knew that their annual getaway trip happened the weekend after Thanksgiving. 
All four men knew to set aside those three days, the three days that followed the holiday, for their own sort of tradition, their own sort of holiday.
All four men were married with children and had demanding jobs, so they found the trip a necessary repose - from life and wife and strife and child - to relax and reconnect. To be guys. 
But the four men had gotten bad about the “annual” part and 5 years passed without one. So this year, it had been decided: they’d get back to it. 
Sam Waterson was cool like California, with tattoos and a beard, and he worked with children, specialized therapy…for those special kids with sensory issues. 
Jack Fowler was sturdy like Montana, a real-life rancher who lived on a sprawling mass of open land with his lovely, homely wife…empty nesters since the kids flew the coop. 
Tommy Jutland was rough like Tennessee, where he worked on cars that were too far-gone in his backyard, gasoline and motor oil always under his fingernails. 
And Camden Sellers was clean-cut like Maine. He managed a hedge fund in the city and made startlingly too much money for the startlingly little amount of work he did. 
Per tradition, they booked the same shitty room at the same shitty motel, a real gaunt roadside pull off out West, simply called MOTEL. Or, really, just M-T-L, because the other letters on the neon sign had burned out. 
Sam Waterson would arrive first and smile. 
Jack Fowler would arrive next and say “Big guy. Hey.” 
Tommy Jutland blew in then, beer in hand, saying “Missed you bastards, mean it” 
And Camden Sellers arrived last, after a delayed flight, calling the weekend to order, remarking how 5 years had passed so quickly.  
Nine days later, when police raided the motel room, they would find a scene of “bizarre devastation”, per the Sheriff’s report. “Bizarre” because one of the beds was missing, nowhere to be found. The floor where it had been was destroyed, by what the Sheriff guessed was an axe (though no weapon had even been recovered) and a large crude hole remained. 
It was from this hole, that the police recovered all of the bodies.  
An alarming amount of narcotics – meth, marijuana, cocaine, fourteen types of prescription medication- were found, littering the space. 
DNA forensics further revealed that the arms of victim 1 had been removed and attached to victim 2 while the legs of victim 3 were attached to the body of victim 4. 
However, they couldn’t figure out exactly how. 
No blood could be collected from the crime scene. The coroner had ruled out stitches, sutures, or any other standard forms of surgical attachment. 
The most baffling question to authorities however, was why the body of the fifth victim appeared, forensically, to be about 5 years further into decomposition than the other four. Sticks and leaves are much too brittle to hold a man my size. If I was being smart, I might have watched where I was going and avoided the hole entirely. Instead, my attention was on my hiking partner. Her jokes and charming demeanor kept be engaged and lively on the trail, but they also made me miss the pit beneath the foliage.
A 15-foot drop isn’t too bad if you see it coming, but it will mess you up if you don’t. Only one of my legs felt broken but the other had lodged itself into a crevice big enough to enter but not big enough to leave. I was stuck. My partner tried to reach me, but the walls of the hole were too slick with moss and the drop too tall to risk climbing down. She ran off to get help leaving me alone in the ditch to fend for myself.
After only a moment, my broken leg already throbbed and my back had begun to twinge from my awkward positioning. I figured the situation was as bad as it could get.
Then I heard the Crick Crack sound. Quiet at first, but gradually getting more prominent as the seconds ticked past.
It started near my feet. Crick, Crack, Crick, Crack.
I felt something slimy on the ankle of my trapped leg. Then on the bleeding calf of the broken one. It inched slowly up my pants leg, leaving a trail of wetness behind it. My body shivered and my skin ran cold.
The sound got louder. Crick, Crack, Crick, Crack. I felt more crawling on the crotch of my pants. Any part of my body that was touching the stones suddenly was overcome with something. Something that made a Crick Crack noise and felt slimy.
Panic overcame me. I tried to brush at the places where I felt it. My hands met small, hard shells and gelatinous bodies. Hundreds of them.
It was the snail’s shells rubbing together that made the noise. No matter how much I tried to brush them off, there were just too many. They engulfed my lower body and inched their way up to my torso. Their assent was slow and maddening. I felt their little eyeball stalks brush against my bare skin as they crawled up my pants legs and underneath my shirt. Crick, Crack, Crick Crack.
Their wet trails had begun to burn ever so slightly as they reached my neck. All I could do was whimper. My friend had still not yet returned and I feared she wouldn’t be able to find me in the dark. I called out for her as the snails began to reach my chin.
They’ve covered me. From my ankles to my eyeballs. 
I hear my friend calling for me from above. But I don’t want them in my mouth. I dare not scream.
There’s only one noise coming that will come from my lips.
Crick, Crack, Crick Crack.Her name was Elizabeth, and she loved asylums. Ever since age 3 she was downright OBSESSED with them. Just the thought of being in an asylum with countless crazies roaming around her, screaming, laughing and crying made her ecstatic.
For years she had been begging her parents to arrange for her to stay a night at the local madhouse, St Kay's Wellness Center, but no matter what she said nor what she did got them to budge. The answer was clearly no. Now, Elizabeth had just turned 18 and she saw this as an opportunity to finally get what she wanted. As a legal adult, she could just call the center and request an empty room for the night, but it would be pretty difficult since she wasn't allowed to use the phone. She sighed and decided to go find her dad. Couldn't hurt to ask one more time.
"Hey daddy! Can I use the phone?" Elizabeth said as she pressed her face to the bars and smiled, a wide, wide smile.
The man looked slightly annoyed. "I'm not your dad, Kenzi. How many times I gotta tell you that?"
Elizabeth's eyes narrowed. "My name. Is not. KENZI!" She snarled, bits of spittle flying out of her mouth and hitting the guard.
Matt brushed his shirt off and stood up. He didn't even bother with an answer. She had been coming up to him with the same question several times a day for 14 years ever since she turned 18.
He walked out of the room.“Save me the merrythought,” I remember my great-nana saying that Thanksgiving evening as my father carved the turkey. She explained that was what they used to call the wishbone, and how long before our modern tradition of simply breaking it and making a wish, they were used to predict the severity of the coming winter. “Kinda like the groundhog,” I remember thinking. Wars were even fought based on its divination. “If we stay up late enough,” she’d said, “I’ll tell you of the coming winter.” I couldn’t wait to hear more.
The rest of the family was long asleep when she turned out the lights and lit the candles. She held the wishbone up to the small flame and examined it, rolling it over in her worn hands, her veins bulging like a winding, frozen river. I remember the candle light dancing in the reflection of her thick bifocals, and the look of shock in her foggy eyes when she stopped spinning the wishbone. I remember the slight gasp and guttural sounds she made as she shook, just before she and the wishbone dropped. I remember being paralyzed and waiting, too long, to see if this was part of nana’s ritual; for her frail form to move, for her head and wiry, gray hair to raise from the table and tell me what she saw.
The family was already gathered together, so we had the funeral only a couple of days later. Black dresses and coattails stewed in the chilly wind. Everyone kept saying she’d had a good, long life, that at least she got to enjoy the holiday, and see the family together before it happened. They all kept asking me how I was doing, not just because of my age, but since I was there. I quietly nodded but could not stop thinking about my nana and how afraid she’d seemed at the end; how she appeared to be trying with all her might to get just one last word to me before surrendering to her fate. And as I wondered, with each passing hour, the temperature dropped.
Only a few days later, winter came. And it has been ever since.
They mutter to themselves and each other, “how could this have happened? How could we not have seen this coming?” I’m the only one who reminds them, as we huddle together and listen to our stomachs growl, that at least one person saw it coming. I’m the only one who ever says, “don’t forget the wishbone.”
I was just a kid then, but I still remember her voice, gentle and inviting like that tiny flame. 
What I can’t remember is what it feels like to be warm, or the taste of turkey.There's a man in a room, in a dark, dark house, who breathes no air yet lives.
He's a tired man, a weary man, a man whose eyes want to close but can't. He reads the pages of a book, a very old book, and the lights are dim and the room is dark so he can barely see the words, the words written in faded, faded ink. But he tries. He's been trying to read the ink for the entire night, the dark dark night – the words burn his tired, tired eyes and say things that are hard to understand. The words say things that are best left for dark, dark nights.
The words say things that the man has heard before, in a different room, in a different house. The words say things that steal what can't be stolen and trick them into believing that they're still there. The words say things that greedy-suck at the light and air with open mouths.
In the dark, the man reads the old, old book and tries to find out what the words took from him in that different room in that different house. He needs to find what's missing because he can feel the hole it left – his insides stretch and churn around the empty space and it hurts, it hurts him. 
It hurts when he has to breathe and can't – he doesn't breathe. It hurts less that way, when he doesn't breathe in the dark, dark room. He doesn't breathe the dust on the old, old book and feel it poison him from within. 
The man sits and reads, not breathing, not breathing, until the dark dark house is light again. He is alive another day and the words still say nothing, nothing he can understand.I am here at the Thanksgiving table surrounded by my family. My mom, my dad, my little brother named Tim and I had just finished eating the turkey my mom cooked for all of us. When she put it on the table we said our prayers then we feasted on the turkey and everything else on the table. While we were eating, my mom and dad were having a conversation about stuff like our president and stuff on TV. I started conversations too with them since I wanted something to do while eating. After I was done eating I took the time to look around at each of my family members thinking of how glad I am to have each of them. I looked at my caring mother who stays at home to care and cook for me and my brother. Then I looked at my father who works hard to make sure we have a roof over our heads and food on the table. Then I looked at my brother who I kinda forgot was here since he was so quiet. He looked down on the floor and I can see his face a little to notice that he looked disappointed.
"What's wrong Tim" I asked. 
Tim looked up to meet my gaze. My mom and dad stopped talking and looked at Tim. They must have forgotten he was here as well and they wanted to know what was wrong. 
"Oh it's nothing" He said.
"What's wrong honey, didn't you like mommy's turkey she cooked for us?" My mom asked with a caring voice.
"No it's not that it's just..." He stopped.
"What?" I asked curiously.
"Well...I wanted the turkey to be alive when we ate it".November 24, 2016:
The night sky was full of lights. My aunt was falling asleep in her chair, only to be awoken by a grasshopper that jumped onto her leg. She brushed it off. Some of the other kids were telling stories, but my eyes were stuck on the sky. In a way, it was beautiful. In another way, it was horrifying.
My parents were in a hospital a few hours away. Their bones were beginning to be eroded at a rapid pace, so they couldn't walk anymore. They've both had to get artificial ribs to prevent any damage to their torso, since the bones frequently fractured without warning, causing massive internal bleeding. Once the spinal column began to degrade, there was nothing that could be done for them. We called it "Bone Mush".
In the distance, a large beam of light hit the ground. The town below it was evaporated instantly, creating a shockwave that went on for at least hundreds of miles. I don't think any of us bothered to care anymore. Suddenly the radio switched from "America's top 100 Classics" to the news.
"The exchange is going well. The UN has called upon the top medical and scientific authorities on Earth to help discuss matters involving the future relationship between humans and 'The Blue Ones'. So far, we've agreed to allow for them to do as they wish, however due to their technological superiority, there is not much of an option. In other news, the Bone Mush outbreak is now affecting around one tenth of the world's population. No treatment or cure has been tested yet, much less found. We hope The Blue Ones may help us deal with this sudden, unprecedented disease."
The radio began playing "Ring of Fire", by Johnny Cash. The radio was mocking us; it was pretty cold outside. This chill was further elevated when the fire caught the worst of the breeze and died out. The coals remaining were glowing.
I was the only one here watching the sky. No one else seemed to care that at any moment we could be turned into dust. The Blue Ones are not our friends! They don't care about humans, they care about taking Earth. No matter how hard we try there is nothing we can do to stop them. Our entire speciesis going to be destroyed and they won't even remember us. They'll just think about how great it was to visit Earth for the first time and have humans help them around. Happy Thanksgiving, visitors.It's nights like these that keep me busy. I mostly deal with the elderly, the homeless, the inebriated, the occasional teenager or two, and far more children than I'd like. Naturally, there are those that are none of the above thrown into the mix, but those are few and far between. Can't say the same about my coworkers' clientele, though.
I don't particularly enjoy meeting those I've been assigned: they're always ashen and shaking once they sense my presence, shaking that leads to bewildered eyes and stiff joints. But a job's a job and given my condition, I don't have the privilege to be picky. None of us do, really.
I try to assure them that it'll be alright – I understand what they're going through far too well – but they never seem to listen until my job is done. It's a shame since it would spare both of us the trouble if they'd just pay attention, but I know focusing can be difficult when I'm around. Oh, how I know.
On extremely rare occasions, one of my assignments will be cancelled by a higher -up for reasons never explained. It can be a bit frustrating when I've been spending hours on a particular case, but I don't mind, in the end. Less of the messy work for me to deal with, as the actual completion of an assignment can be...an ordeal, at times. Most of them are fairly straightforward, but some of my clients are not nearly as cooperative. That, of course, can be easily remedied, but I prefer to let them have their freedom while it lasts.
It's nights like these that keep me busy. Better keep your coat on, or I'll be there for you next.He knew by the paunch. 
He had always told himself that when there was a paunch around his waist - as there was now- that it'd be time to accept that he had, in fact, entered Midlife. 
And Midlife meant that soon, a crisis was to accompany. Inevitable. 
All his life, he had been so diligent about staying in shape. 
He ate healthy. 
He moisturized. 
He dressed well. 
Suits. 
Ties. 
Cole Haan. 
His wife appreciated it and let him know, kissing him each night and saying "Love you, Handsome". His daughter's little girlfriends giggled nervously  around him, like little Electras, and he'd act like he didn't notice. 
The guys at work envied him, too - though they'd never admit it-for his handsomeness. 
For his build. 
For his presence. 
He was the suit and tie, the silver hair, you'd see and envy. 
A real good man. 
A real good man...with a paunch. 
And that extra fat, that extra skin, that paunch, worked wonders against his self-confidence.
He felt ugly.
He felt weak. 
And he hated feeling weak. 
So he decided it was time to live his life. 
Live with a capital L Live. 
Live by doing whatever he wanted. 
Live like traveling. 
Live like enjoying a nice meal. 
Live like learning a new language. 
That was it. 
Throw worry to the wind and Live. 
So every day, instead of going to lunch, he'd pop in the repetitive tape- he had decided on Thai- and soon he was confident in his abilities, speaking it around the house. His wife appreciated it and was impressed- "look at you!" she'd say, impressed. And his daughter's little girlfriends giggled nervously  around him, hearing a towering silver-haired daddy of a man speak such a foreign tongue. 
But he had to to do it. 
Because when he got to Thailand, it'd make things so much easier. 
Because when he got to Thailand, he could say "under 13" and they'd know what he meant. 
Because when he got to Thailand, he could say, "I don't care how much" and they'd understand him. 
Because when he got to Thailand, the little girl he purchased, wouldn't care about the paunch. “Please, everyone, put your hands together for prayer.” Everyone complied, and we fell silent as Father began.
“Firstly, we must be thankful that God has provided us with such a bountiful feast, and that we are all together for this heartwarming occasion.” 
“We have been luckier than most, and we should be glad that we have not lost any of those who matter to us.” 
“Let us take a moment of silence for the McMillers, who have lost their eldest son and youngest daughter to the Freeze.” I involuntarily glance outside, at the living ice flying about the air, its cold heart consuming the poor souls who wander inside its body. I’ve always hated the Freeze.
“This year, we will skip taking turns and giving our thanks, for I believe we are thankful for the same things. Being inside, safe and warm from the Freeze,” True. “Having family and feast alike to weather the raging storm outside,” Kinda. “And resting peacefully, knowing all the nonbelievers in our great God have received punishment this year.” 
 “With that, I conclude prayer. Enjoy your meal, everyone.”
My stomach reeling, I glance at this year’s “turkey.” Apparently poor Anne wasn’t religious enough.Not a normal girl. 
Even though she mostly acted like one. 
Kitten ears, a cat tail, sharp teeth. 
Of course, she looked up to you. 
Must be the reason why she called you, “Master”. 
Unknowingly, you left the front door unlocked when you went to work this morning. 
Somebody got in. 
Ultimately, you came home later than expected. 
Master adoration sparkles in her eyes. 
Even though they lie on the carpet.So yah today I saw a Djinn. The weird thing about this all is I live in Connecticut, so I mean as far as I'm concerned I shouldn't really have to worry about this kind of thing. So today I went to my Aunt's house for thanksgiving and when we got home my little sister needed to go to her friends house to pick up her shirt she left there and for whatever reason both of my parents went. I am a senior in high school so I was outside playing basketball by myself as it became dark, I then noticed something weird. Let me explain my surroundings. My house is on the "main road" of our town about 15 feet above the road on a hill, across the street is a much bigger hill with more houses. Okay I was playing basketball and I looked up on top of the hill across the street and there was a figure, maybe a little taller then a normal human being standing there, arms at it's side, looking at me. Rather staring actually. Or I guess it was because the eyes on this things were so bright I had to turn away almost immediately. They were white and then yellow and back to white every few seconds. I was now squinting to get a better look at it when it became even brighter. At this point I couldn't even look in it's direction. Ya know when u stare at lights and you can see the beems of light coming off of them? Well the beems were all I could see and I was looking 90 degrees away from it in a completely different direction. I ended up running away and by the time I got the balls to look back it's direction it wasn't there. As far as I know that's what a Djinn looks like. Anyone have any ideas as to what it might be?For the past month or two SSS veteran

Questions? Comments? Gravy Jokes? Leave'em below!Anna hated stubble. There wasn't a feeling in the world that annoyed her like the feeling of hairs on her legs. She shaved daily, trying to prevent those little spots, but they kept growing, and growing. Waxing didn't help long enough, lasers weren't reliable yet, she had tried every miracle product and none worked, so she shaved. 
She'd spent the last hour trying to get to the root of the problem. The blades scraped untill they were blunt, but she just kept seeing those damn hairs. It was maddening. Tired and slightly lightheaded, she took a break to check on her progress.
A smile spread across Anna's face. She laughed happily as she put a new razor blade on her leg. Almost there. After all, her problem was only skin deep.Two days ago, my camera broke. Accidentally dropped it in a pool if you're wondering and I was going on holiday in a few weeks so I quickly needed a replacement. A new camera was too expensive so I had to resort to eBay to replace my ruined camera.
I browsed a few pages and noted a few good examples when I stumbled on a great deal, a camera exactly my own but it was being sold for a tenth of the price! The seller had a lot of positive feedback and the images showed that it was in perfect order so I quickly placed a bid and waited, two days later, the camera was mine.
I gave my address to the seller, gave the man his money and eagerly awaited my purchase. I soon received a simple brown package with a label showing my sending details and quickly opened it to see my new camera. I snapped a few shots and it was as he said, but before I was finished, I decided to check the SD card.
I plugged it into my crappy $600 laptop and saw there was one folder labeled "PICTURES", I opened it to see seven pictures unimaginatively labeled 001, 002, 003 etc. I clicked on 001 to see a shipping label, a bit weird but nothing more. The next picture left me trembling. It was a corpse. A freshly murdered 
. I quickly went to the next picture to see what was next. It was another shipping label, I knew what was next but was still sick when I saw it. It was like this until I reached 007. It was my shipping address.
That's why I'm writing this, I just heard knocking on my door. It hasn't stopped in 20 minutes and is only getting harder. I called 911 a quarter of an hour ago but they won't be here in time. Because I just heard my dining room window shatter.There once was a small forest nearby a small village that the locals called the Forest of Laughter. It was an attraction for many of the villager’s children, to go and spend their days playing in the forest ‘til the sunset, while the adults were working in the fields. It got that name, because sometimes, if the wind was right, and the ground was calm, you could hear the children’s laughter coming from those woods. The younglings were usually found playing in a naked small field, that was located in the middle of the forest, that the villagers referred to as the Oak Field. It was covered with a short moist grass, that always felt like it was coated in a morning dew and it stayed that way even on hottest of days. At the center of this field, there was an old, thick branched oak tree. It had many carvings of the children names on its trunk, some cuts were so deep, the sap from the oak never stopped bleeding, as the wounds were too deep to heal. The villagers, both young and old loved the forest, for what it provided to the little community.
On one of the sunsets, however, a villager’s daughter Gloria, an eight year old with a yellow dress didn't return from the forest as usual. When other kids, who came back from it, were asked by the worried father, if they've seen her, they all just shook their heads. The country men gathered the torches and began the search. The whole forest was searched, throughout the night and day, inch by inch, but the girl was never found.
Few days later, when the search was over, to the surprise of the villagers and the mourning father, little Gloria emerged from the woods right before the sunset. The strangest thing was that the girl was happy and laughing, as if nothing bad have happened. When asked where she was those past few days, she simply shrugged her shoulders and said: “I was just playing with the kids.”
Few days later, the daughter’s father decided to go into the forest alone, while the girl was sleeping at home. He took his torch and went into the woods just as the sunset light has scorched the sky with its reddish tint. As he reached the Oak Field, he noticed a small silhouette resting on the grass, it’s back leaned to the old Oak. Once he reached the silhouette, the light of torch revealed something that made the man paralyzed for a moment. It was a corpse of a little girl in a yellow dress. Above her head, on the Oak’s trunk there was a fresh carve, from which the sap continued to bleed out. It read “Gloria”. Once he read it, his horrified eyes stared back to the direction of the village as he silently asked himself: “Who is she?”
As the sun completely set, and the red sky turned black, you could hear the children's laughter from the forest as it took another prey.I'm always finding stray hairs all over the place. 
My apartment is covered in them. Some are in the usual places. On my pillow, on my bathroom counter, and in the drain of my shower. Others are in more weirder locations like in my refrigerator and on the ceiling fan. A few even end up in my mouth. I can't help but feel unnerved when I come across them. I shouldn't feel uncomfortable with finding stray hairs in my living space. 
An explanation is in order. I'm a woman, one who has a full head of hair and who likes to grow it out. My hair is thick and usually falls off on its own so, I should expect rogue strands. 
That being said, I shouldn't expect them to be short and black when I'm a brunette. 'Oh yes, we have a ghost,' your hostess says, as she leads you to your bedroom.
Of course the place would be haunted. The inn is ancient – more than 500 years old. But this was meant to be a relaxing holiday. 'Go somewhere quiet,' your doctor had told you. 'No surprises. Just somewhere to rest, in peace.' If only your car hadn't broken down, leaving you stuck out here all night.
'It's a bit boring really,' she continues, with a shrug. 'Nobody has ever never seen anything – just heard footsteps occasionally.' 
As your hostess bids you goodnight and closes the door, you fight against the urge to run to it and barricade yourself in. Instead, you make yourself walk to the door, lock it slowly, and then slowly and carefully go to the window and draw the curtains. As you lie down you take more deep breaths until your heartbeat slows and you feel calm again.
As you settle down under the covers you soon find yourself drifting off. Only to hear a sound coming from outside your door, in the corridor. Footsteps? No, not footsteps. don't be ridiculous. You are hearing things. Probably just a waking dream. You gradually drift back to sleep again. Only to hear – footsteps. Yes, definitely footsteps, and not from a guest. These are hollow, peculiar, and seem to come from the other end of time. Why are you frightening yourself like this? They make your hair stand on end. How could you have thought they were a dream? They have stopped. No, they will keep on coming. They will not stop. Your heart is hammering faster and faster. Please, stop! Your breath comes out in shuddering gasps, and you cannot stop it. The footsteps coming closer and closer, louder and louder until – suddenly, there is silence.
Now you are not afraid any more. In fact, you feel strangely lighthearted. What an idiot you were! To be actually afraid of a noise! A noise cannot hurt you. You laugh to yourself and turn over to go back to sleep, but strangely, considering how tired you were before, sleep eludes you. Instead, you sit up to see a very curious thing. Slowly, tendrils of mist are gathering at the end of your bed. You watch, entranced, as they form themselves into – a ghost! A whiskery old man, dressed in pantaloons, an old style coat and neckerchief, sitting on the end of your bed, looking at you. But you are not a bit scared. Instead you are just merely intrigued. You remember the story from earlier.
'What an odd thing,' you say, and your voice sounds hoarse in your ears. 'My hostess said nobody had ever seen the ghost.'
'Nobody living,' the ghost replies with a sinister grin. 'Your heart stopped beating five minutes ago.'Silently, I stood before the open casket, gazing down at my sister's face. "Bethany? Are you okay?" my father asked, his hand upon my shoulder. "I just...I can't believe she's gone." I whispered, my voice trembling. "If I hadn't lost touch with her-" "Oh, honey." my mother said, hugging me as I began to cry. "Don't blame yourself. Nobody knew Victoria was going to poison herself, even with the problems she had." Still, I feel bad." I said through sobs. "Even after the times she picked on me, I still loved her." "We know, dear." My father replied. "You've always been as sweet as Momma's pumpkin pie." "Thanks, Daddy." I said meekly. "Do you want to ride home with us?" my mother then asked. "Thanks, Momma, but I'm not quite ready to leave Vicki just yet. Besides, I got Patrick here with me." "Okay, darlin',  we'll see you at the house then." "Okay." I said. They both then gave me a sad smile before leaving me alone with my sister's corpse.

  Once I was sure they were gone, I wiped the tears away and rolled my eyes in disgust. "That was quite the performance, sugar." Patrick said as he entered the room. "Why, thank you." I replied before he pulled me in for a kiss. "Sweet as Momma's pumpkin pie, like Daddy always says. Though not as sweet as candy yams drizzled with antifreeze. One would've thought she drank too much wine the way it affected her." "That's for sure." he replied, wrapping his arms around me. "Deep down, I always preferred my pumpkin pie with a bit more spice." He then grinned mischievously, making my heart skip a beat. "God, I love you, Mr. Mason." "And I love you, Mrs. Mason." Mrs. Mason. The sound of it filled me with joy. I was finally in the spotlight. I then took one last look at my twin's face. "Sweet dreams, Beth." I giggled as I closed the casket's lid.He was crotchety, irritable – the skin on his face more like melted candle-wax than human flesh – but for an 125-year-old, he was surprisingly alert.
I carefully considered how to begin the conversation, while children, unperturbed by our presence, milled about the classroom.
“Today, I'm meeting with the last living person to have directly witnessed the religious genocide 115 years ago...”
I hadn't even completed my introduction before he interjected. “There was no genocide.”
“I understand that's your position...”
“I was here, 
 it allegedly happened,” he said, swirling his cane at our surroundings. “
 it allegedly happened. As a member of the religious group that was allegedly persecuted. I'm still alive. And I tell you, firmly, 
”
I bit my lip, watching children dutifully recite the pledge of allegiance, hands at their hearts. 
“There are photographs.”
“Easily faked. Hire actors. Use Photoshop. It's easy. There are also very few. Maybe 100 total, reposted every time someone wants to make a political point.”
“They say the state censored evidence,” I countered. “There were more photographs, but they were expunged from the historical record.”
“Hogwash,” he spat. “When the radicals took power, they falsified documents to demonize their forebears.”
“There were internment camps...”
He sighed. “They were for our own good. We learned how backwards it was to worship some mystical sky-man that'd cast us into eternal hellfire if we ate improperly-butchered meat. The reason there're barely any religious adherents today is because we embraced modernity, not because the state murdered us.”
I nodded, unsure how to proceed. 
“And now, thanks to Eidetech,” he continued, casting his gaze into the classroom, “There's proof.”
Eidetech. An experimental service that allowed elderly people to upload memories to a server to preserve them for future generations.
“You can access any of my memories, any time, and see for yourself.”
So here we were. Observing a perfectly normal classroom full of bright-eyed-and-bushy-tailed ten-year-olds. In an internment camp for religious re-education. 115 years ago.
I opened my briefcase.
“Hackers leaked your health records to the press,” I said, dropping them on the desk. “They indicate a family history of Alzheimer's disease.”
He didn't react.
“Do you actually remember this? Or just trust the memories Eidetech provides?”
He smirked. “Why would Eidetech create 
 memories?”
“Maybe they're bigots.”
He shrugged. “Look – I'm the last person to see the internment camps. This is how I remember them. If we can't trust our own memories, what can we believe?”
I had no answer.
“But even if you're right... isn't this a more pleasant past than what they teach in school?”
I recalled the historical photographs. Hollow faces peeking from behind chainlink fences. Piled corpses, fresh from the incinerator, smoking in the snowbanks.
We watched sunbeams filter through the windowpane. Children happily stacked blocks and carefully coloured at their desks. It 
 pleasant.
“Maybe... there was no genocide,” I conceded.So... By the time i was a teen i was used to seeing the paranormal, especially while alone. But there were a few times i experienced things while with others. This is one account.
One summer my step sister was staying with us. We loved to sit in the back of my mother's townhouse. From the back porch we could see a small patch of trees and houses in front of us and to our side there was a drainage reservoir that was fenced in to keep kids out. And beyond that there was a small patch of a wooded  area. 
We would sit back there for hours just talking and laughing. One day on the concrete tunnel that separated the reservoir from the wooded area sat a teen boy about our age. He sat there as to just enjoy the day. After a few minutes of us looking over and gaining his attention he stood up. Red cap, white shirt, red shorts, and white shoes. As he walked to the corner of the fence we kinda laughed n realized he was looking our way as to come up to us. As he rounded the fence to come our way......he disappeared. We went up to our room n stayed there the rest of the night.
I guess the rumors about a teen boy hanging himself in that wooded area, were true.I don’t know why I wake up with the same idea again and again. Like a cosset tape that keeps getting flipped, but always on side B. Maybe it is a dream that I keep having, however, no matter how much I try to remember I see nothing but a black canvas appears in my mind. I’m not sure why I can’t relive myself from this idea. Like somehow it is the thing that defines who I am for the day, and the next one after. Recursion, a trapped loop without a break in sight. I can’t help it, the idea consumes me, stalking me at every thought. Oh, how I beg for some release. Like I should know it is not possible, it is untruthful, but the idea sinks deep into my veins.
Escaping the idea is useless. I tend to my day, eating cereal on my small dining room table. Watching the flakes of cereal float and contort onto themselves. What makes a single flake follow the lead of my spoon. Why do some decide to float away, while others benevolently fall into the spoon. Are some flakes of cereal inherently ready to die?
This sweet moment of freedom gets flush away once again by the idea. Why can’t I get pass the idea… Again, it is back, even when I’m trying to consume a simple meal. Again, it is back, even when I squeeze on my tie so tight, begging it to free me from my own conscious. Again, it is back, when I’m trying to slide my neatly ordered reports into my leather briefcase. Again, again, and again. I want some sweet escape from this idea once again.
The boring day in a cubical. The walls blank with fears, of nothing to hang but failed dreams. Wait, do I even still have dreams. What is the idea. Spreadsheet, two plus two equals four, no… 2+2=4… No, one plus three equals four. Wrong again, three plus one equals four. What am I doing, trying to hide this idea again. Hide the reality that I can not escape this idea again. Why do I keep this idea when I could just forget it, leave it all behind. But I continue, zero plus four is four.
I’m not crazy, I talk normal, I act normal, and I eat normal. The odd thing is that I can’t help but giggle. People talk around me, eating and nibbling on their mom’s mac and cheese. I wounder if they have the idea. Maybe they have a different idea. What if I’m the only one with this idea? The grins that I show, while sharing a fake story to hide my idea. Why would I share this idea with anyone? It is my idea, even if they asked. It is mine — my idea.
I don’t want to go back to sleep, I’ll just have the idea again and the idea will have me. I just don’t want this idea anymore. Sure it is my idea. But the same idea again and again. How am I not mad? I mean I know I am not. I can’t be mad, maybe angry. What is with the dream. The dark canvas. You can’t paint on a place where light does not exist. So, again, why do I have this idea. Why do I burden myself with this idea. My idea.
Author note: I do suffer in grammar, however, I am trying to improve. If you do see any syntactically malformed sentences, then please let me know. Hope you enjoyed.One day i was going through YouTube and i watched a video about the channel 666. well i wanted to check it out because i thaught it was fake. i typed out ''666'' and there came the reasults of what i tpued out. i clicked on the first thing that was there and the screen of my computer became all red. it kinda looked like blood. well i obviously tried to get outta that site but whenever i pressed back it didn't work. i accedently pressed a video. it was about a teenager girl. she lookrd like she was 15 years old. she was smiling at the start of the video but then she picked up a big knife. she was showing it to the camera. she then started to cut her right cheek off! i tried to stop the video cause it looked disgusting. but it didn't work. she cut her cheek off! she then started cutting off her left cheek. i was so disgusted. i didn't know what to do. after she cut it of she fainted. the computer just froze. i was so damn lucky it froze...At first, we thought the black liquid was oil, that we'd struck it rich and that we'd be able to retire and live in leisure.
We actually started writing down all the ways we'd spend the money.
Our first choice was to spend until we had our dreams. Houses, cars, pets, food... We'd spend as much as we wanted to spend, and we'd be happy.
Of course, we'd probably run out of money soon after.
Our second choice was to spend mostly on the necessities, only indulging on luxuries when we were sure we were stable.
Sadly, our dreams were cut short as we dug deeper, and realized that we hadn't hit oil.
Whatever it was, its eyes were gleaming as it started to rise from the ground.She opens the door and is immediately hit with the smell of jammed printer and paranoia. 
It is burning hot and just-hidden under speckled skin and bone, wire-thin fingers depressing the small character-inscribed squares of the portable computer keyboard; same characters appearing on the white screen of the number-cruncher (this time not numbers, records - have to write it down in case she can't remember. It only makes sense, understandable) lights dimmed, (lightbulbs old – have to be replaced) and the hands hitting the machine trembling; machine growling, lights blinking, paper snarled and scribbled over with more characters (what do they say) in blueness. Extension cords on the floor (fire hazard – the floor should be free and clear in case they come, have to leave quickly), rug bunched up under the chair legs (will wrinkle, in time that may not); trash on the floor, filthy, burn smell. The locks are not strong enough, the windows too open behind the thin cardboard and curtains. The hands curl, fists ready to fight, have to fight (outmatched most likely, can't fight well or long enough, no weapons), someone is here and they will find out, they will read and pry head open to find questions being asked. Nails bite
She is the one at the table, typing.
The door is out of reach (twenty feet) and there is nobody (only the one here – at the doorway too but not right now, this now) reading these letters. No wind at the windows, shored; locks intact and fastened, none broken or picked. Lights off to reduce electricity consumption and pretend inactivity (somewhere it is morning, early early morning – not many are up this early, can arise suspicion). Safe. Extension cords bundled (neat and tidy – easily moved and stepped over) and tucked against intact whitewashed wall. Only one in the room this now; others walk in different now but not interacting with her. Clutter under control (no control – randomness is key, observation ties down) printer under control, jam fixed; lightbulbs florescent, lasting years more (fifty – cracks deteriorate, leak. No cracks mean seventy). All from another now, distant; palms whole, hands type locations likelihoods observations 
She is not in the room and the printer is broken, paranoia smelling like burnt toast.There was a moment of hesitation, and the radio crackled to life. A soft voice struggled not to drown in the rain Diane saw rushing past her window. She parted her lips, whispering steam onto the glass: “Do you hear me?” Beyond, the world glowed with the promise of a never-ending night, a vibrance she’d grown to long for in the quiet void between the trees. She looked up into the abyss and forced herself to focus instead on the soothing buzz beside her. “…to remain the same through the end of the week. That means it’s as good a time as any to fix that hole in your roof before you awake in a indoor pool”. Diane smiled. She wished she could reciprocate, express her gratitude to that for which she’d grown a feverish desire. She sighed away the ache, looking deep into the forest until the radio once more sang static, and she found herself alone again. She did not remember.All four men knew that their annual getaway trip happened the weekend after Thanksgiving. 
All four men knew to set aside those three days, the three days that followed the holiday, for their own sort of tradition, their own sort of holiday.
All four men were married with children and had demanding jobs, so they found the trip a necessary repose - from life and wife and strife and child - to relax and reconnect. To be guys. 
But the four men had gotten bad about the “annual” part and 5 years passed without one. So this year, it had been decided: they’d get back to it. 
Sam Waterson was cool like California, with tattoos and a beard, and he worked with children, specialized therapy…for those special kids with sensory issues. 
Jack Fowler was sturdy like Montana, a real-life rancher who lived on a sprawling mass of open land with his lovely, homely wife…empty nesters since the kids flew the coop. 
Tommy Jutland was rough like Tennessee, where he worked on cars that were too far-gone in his backyard, gasoline and motor oil always under his fingernails. 
And Camden Sellers was clean-cut like Maine. He managed a hedge fund in the city and made startlingly too much money for the startlingly little amount of work he did. 
Per tradition, they booked the same shitty room at the same shitty motel, a real gaunt roadside pull off out West, simply called MOTEL. Or, really, just M-T-L, because the other letters on the neon sign had burned out. 
Sam Waterson would arrive first and smile. 
Jack Fowler would arrive next and say “Big guy. Hey.” 
Tommy Jutland blew in then, beer in hand, saying “Missed you bastards, mean it” 
And Camden Sellers arrived last, after a delayed flight, calling the weekend to order, remarking how 5 years had passed so quickly.  
Nine days later, when police raided the motel room, they would find a scene of “bizarre devastation”, per the Sheriff’s report. “Bizarre” because one of the beds was missing, nowhere to be found. The floor where it had been was destroyed, by what the Sheriff guessed was an axe (though no weapon had even been recovered) and a large crude hole remained. 
It was from this hole, that the police recovered all of the bodies.  
An alarming amount of narcotics – meth, marijuana, cocaine, fourteen types of prescription medication- were found, littering the space. 
DNA forensics further revealed that the arms of victim 1 had been removed and attached to victim 2 while the legs of victim 3 were attached to the body of victim 4. 
However, they couldn’t figure out exactly how. 
No blood could be collected from the crime scene. The coroner had ruled out stitches, sutures, or any other standard forms of surgical attachment. 
The most baffling question to authorities however, was why the body of the fifth victim appeared, forensically, to be about 5 years further into decomposition than the other four. Sticks and leaves are much too brittle to hold a man my size. If I was being smart, I might have watched where I was going and avoided the hole entirely. Instead, my attention was on my hiking partner. Her jokes and charming demeanor kept be engaged and lively on the trail, but they also made me miss the pit beneath the foliage.
A 15-foot drop isn’t too bad if you see it coming, but it will mess you up if you don’t. Only one of my legs felt broken but the other had lodged itself into a crevice big enough to enter but not big enough to leave. I was stuck. My partner tried to reach me, but the walls of the hole were too slick with moss and the drop too tall to risk climbing down. She ran off to get help leaving me alone in the ditch to fend for myself.
After only a moment, my broken leg already throbbed and my back had begun to twinge from my awkward positioning. I figured the situation was as bad as it could get.
Then I heard the Crick Crack sound. Quiet at first, but gradually getting more prominent as the seconds ticked past.
It started near my feet. Crick, Crack, Crick, Crack.
I felt something slimy on the ankle of my trapped leg. Then on the bleeding calf of the broken one. It inched slowly up my pants leg, leaving a trail of wetness behind it. My body shivered and my skin ran cold.
The sound got louder. Crick, Crack, Crick, Crack. I felt more crawling on the crotch of my pants. Any part of my body that was touching the stones suddenly was overcome with something. Something that made a Crick Crack noise and felt slimy.
Panic overcame me. I tried to brush at the places where I felt it. My hands met small, hard shells and gelatinous bodies. Hundreds of them.
It was the snail’s shells rubbing together that made the noise. No matter how much I tried to brush them off, there were just too many. They engulfed my lower body and inched their way up to my torso. Their assent was slow and maddening. I felt their little eyeball stalks brush against my bare skin as they crawled up my pants legs and underneath my shirt. Crick, Crack, Crick Crack.
Their wet trails had begun to burn ever so slightly as they reached my neck. All I could do was whimper. My friend had still not yet returned and I feared she wouldn’t be able to find me in the dark. I called out for her as the snails began to reach my chin.
They’ve covered me. From my ankles to my eyeballs. 
I hear my friend calling for me from above. But I don’t want them in my mouth. I dare not scream.
There’s only one noise coming that will come from my lips.
Crick, Crack, Crick Crack.Her name was Elizabeth, and she loved asylums. Ever since age 3 she was downright OBSESSED with them. Just the thought of being in an asylum with countless crazies roaming around her, screaming, laughing and crying made her ecstatic.
For years she had been begging her parents to arrange for her to stay a night at the local madhouse, St Kay's Wellness Center, but no matter what she said nor what she did got them to budge. The answer was clearly no. Now, Elizabeth had just turned 18 and she saw this as an opportunity to finally get what she wanted. As a legal adult, she could just call the center and request an empty room for the night, but it would be pretty difficult since she wasn't allowed to use the phone. She sighed and decided to go find her dad. Couldn't hurt to ask one more time.
"Hey daddy! Can I use the phone?" Elizabeth said as she pressed her face to the bars and smiled, a wide, wide smile.
The man looked slightly annoyed. "I'm not your dad, Kenzi. How many times I gotta tell you that?"
Elizabeth's eyes narrowed. "My name. Is not. KENZI!" She snarled, bits of spittle flying out of her mouth and hitting the guard.
Matt brushed his shirt off and stood up. He didn't even bother with an answer. She had been coming up to him with the same question several times a day for 14 years ever since she turned 18.
He walked out of the room.“Save me the merrythought,” I remember my great-nana saying that Thanksgiving evening as my father carved the turkey. She explained that was what they used to call the wishbone, and how long before our modern tradition of simply breaking it and making a wish, they were used to predict the severity of the coming winter. “Kinda like the groundhog,” I remember thinking. Wars were even fought based on its divination. “If we stay up late enough,” she’d said, “I’ll tell you of the coming winter.” I couldn’t wait to hear more.
The rest of the family was long asleep when she turned out the lights and lit the candles. She held the wishbone up to the small flame and examined it, rolling it over in her worn hands, her veins bulging like a winding, frozen river. I remember the candle light dancing in the reflection of her thick bifocals, and the look of shock in her foggy eyes when she stopped spinning the wishbone. I remember the slight gasp and guttural sounds she made as she shook, just before she and the wishbone dropped. I remember being paralyzed and waiting, too long, to see if this was part of nana’s ritual; for her frail form to move, for her head and wiry, gray hair to raise from the table and tell me what she saw.
The family was already gathered together, so we had the funeral only a couple of days later. Black dresses and coattails stewed in the chilly wind. Everyone kept saying she’d had a good, long life, that at least she got to enjoy the holiday, and see the family together before it happened. They all kept asking me how I was doing, not just because of my age, but since I was there. I quietly nodded but could not stop thinking about my nana and how afraid she’d seemed at the end; how she appeared to be trying with all her might to get just one last word to me before surrendering to her fate. And as I wondered, with each passing hour, the temperature dropped.
Only a few days later, winter came. And it has been ever since.
They mutter to themselves and each other, “how could this have happened? How could we not have seen this coming?” I’m the only one who reminds them, as we huddle together and listen to our stomachs growl, that at least one person saw it coming. I’m the only one who ever says, “don’t forget the wishbone.”
I was just a kid then, but I still remember her voice, gentle and inviting like that tiny flame. 
What I can’t remember is what it feels like to be warm, or the taste of turkey.There's a man in a room, in a dark, dark house, who breathes no air yet lives.
He's a tired man, a weary man, a man whose eyes want to close but can't. He reads the pages of a book, a very old book, and the lights are dim and the room is dark so he can barely see the words, the words written in faded, faded ink. But he tries. He's been trying to read the ink for the entire night, the dark dark night – the words burn his tired, tired eyes and say things that are hard to understand. The words say things that are best left for dark, dark nights.
The words say things that the man has heard before, in a different room, in a different house. The words say things that steal what can't be stolen and trick them into believing that they're still there. The words say things that greedy-suck at the light and air with open mouths.
In the dark, the man reads the old, old book and tries to find out what the words took from him in that different room in that different house. He needs to find what's missing because he can feel the hole it left – his insides stretch and churn around the empty space and it hurts, it hurts him. 
It hurts when he has to breathe and can't – he doesn't breathe. It hurts less that way, when he doesn't breathe in the dark, dark room. He doesn't breathe the dust on the old, old book and feel it poison him from within. 
The man sits and reads, not breathing, not breathing, until the dark dark house is light again. He is alive another day and the words still say nothing, nothing he can understand.I am here at the Thanksgiving table surrounded by my family. My mom, my dad, my little brother named Tim and I had just finished eating the turkey my mom cooked for all of us. When she put it on the table we said our prayers then we feasted on the turkey and everything else on the table. While we were eating, my mom and dad were having a conversation about stuff like our president and stuff on TV. I started conversations too with them since I wanted something to do while eating. After I was done eating I took the time to look around at each of my family members thinking of how glad I am to have each of them. I looked at my caring mother who stays at home to care and cook for me and my brother. Then I looked at my father who works hard to make sure we have a roof over our heads and food on the table. Then I looked at my brother who I kinda forgot was here since he was so quiet. He looked down on the floor and I can see his face a little to notice that he looked disappointed.
"What's wrong Tim" I asked. 
Tim looked up to meet my gaze. My mom and dad stopped talking and looked at Tim. They must have forgotten he was here as well and they wanted to know what was wrong. 
"Oh it's nothing" He said.
"What's wrong honey, didn't you like mommy's turkey she cooked for us?" My mom asked with a caring voice.
"No it's not that it's just..." He stopped.
"What?" I asked curiously.
"Well...I wanted the turkey to be alive when we ate it".November 24, 2016:
The night sky was full of lights. My aunt was falling asleep in her chair, only to be awoken by a grasshopper that jumped onto her leg. She brushed it off. Some of the other kids were telling stories, but my eyes were stuck on the sky. In a way, it was beautiful. In another way, it was horrifying.
My parents were in a hospital a few hours away. Their bones were beginning to be eroded at a rapid pace, so they couldn't walk anymore. They've both had to get artificial ribs to prevent any damage to their torso, since the bones frequently fractured without warning, causing massive internal bleeding. Once the spinal column began to degrade, there was nothing that could be done for them. We called it "Bone Mush".
In the distance, a large beam of light hit the ground. The town below it was evaporated instantly, creating a shockwave that went on for at least hundreds of miles. I don't think any of us bothered to care anymore. Suddenly the radio switched from "America's top 100 Classics" to the news.
"The exchange is going well. The UN has called upon the top medical and scientific authorities on Earth to help discuss matters involving the future relationship between humans and 'The Blue Ones'. So far, we've agreed to allow for them to do as they wish, however due to their technological superiority, there is not much of an option. In other news, the Bone Mush outbreak is now affecting around one tenth of the world's population. No treatment or cure has been tested yet, much less found. We hope The Blue Ones may help us deal with this sudden, unprecedented disease."
The radio began playing "Ring of Fire", by Johnny Cash. The radio was mocking us; it was pretty cold outside. This chill was further elevated when the fire caught the worst of the breeze and died out. The coals remaining were glowing.
I was the only one here watching the sky. No one else seemed to care that at any moment we could be turned into dust. The Blue Ones are not our friends! They don't care about humans, they care about taking Earth. No matter how hard we try there is nothing we can do to stop them. Our entire speciesis going to be destroyed and they won't even remember us. They'll just think about how great it was to visit Earth for the first time and have humans help them around. Happy Thanksgiving, visitors.It's nights like these that keep me busy. I mostly deal with the elderly, the homeless, the inebriated, the occasional teenager or two, and far more children than I'd like. Naturally, there are those that are none of the above thrown into the mix, but those are few and far between. Can't say the same about my coworkers' clientele, though.
I don't particularly enjoy meeting those I've been assigned: they're always ashen and shaking once they sense my presence, shaking that leads to bewildered eyes and stiff joints. But a job's a job and given my condition, I don't have the privilege to be picky. None of us do, really.
I try to assure them that it'll be alright – I understand what they're going through far too well – but they never seem to listen until my job is done. It's a shame since it would spare both of us the trouble if they'd just pay attention, but I know focusing can be difficult when I'm around. Oh, how I know.
On extremely rare occasions, one of my assignments will be cancelled by a higher -up for reasons never explained. It can be a bit frustrating when I've been spending hours on a particular case, but I don't mind, in the end. Less of the messy work for me to deal with, as the actual completion of an assignment can be...an ordeal, at times. Most of them are fairly straightforward, but some of my clients are not nearly as cooperative. That, of course, can be easily remedied, but I prefer to let them have their freedom while it lasts.
It's nights like these that keep me busy. Better keep your coat on, or I'll be there for you next.He knew by the paunch. 
He had always told himself that when there was a paunch around his waist - as there was now- that it'd be time to accept that he had, in fact, entered Midlife. 
And Midlife meant that soon, a crisis was to accompany. Inevitable. 
All his life, he had been so diligent about staying in shape. 
He ate healthy. 
He moisturized. 
He dressed well. 
Suits. 
Ties. 
Cole Haan. 
His wife appreciated it and let him know, kissing him each night and saying "Love you, Handsome". His daughter's little girlfriends giggled nervously  around him, like little Electras, and he'd act like he didn't notice. 
The guys at work envied him, too - though they'd never admit it-for his handsomeness. 
For his build. 
For his presence. 
He was the suit and tie, the silver hair, you'd see and envy. 
A real good man. 
A real good man...with a paunch. 
And that extra fat, that extra skin, that paunch, worked wonders against his self-confidence.
He felt ugly.
He felt weak. 
And he hated feeling weak. 
So he decided it was time to live his life. 
Live with a capital L Live. 
Live by doing whatever he wanted. 
Live like traveling. 
Live like enjoying a nice meal. 
Live like learning a new language. 
That was it. 
Throw worry to the wind and Live. 
So every day, instead of going to lunch, he'd pop in the repetitive tape- he had decided on Thai- and soon he was confident in his abilities, speaking it around the house. His wife appreciated it and was impressed- "look at you!" she'd say, impressed. And his daughter's little girlfriends giggled nervously  around him, hearing a towering silver-haired daddy of a man speak such a foreign tongue. 
But he had to to do it. 
Because when he got to Thailand, it'd make things so much easier. 
Because when he got to Thailand, he could say "under 13" and they'd know what he meant. 
Because when he got to Thailand, he could say, "I don't care how much" and they'd understand him. 
Because when he got to Thailand, the little girl he purchased, wouldn't care about the paunch. “Please, everyone, put your hands together for prayer.” Everyone complied, and we fell silent as Father began.
“Firstly, we must be thankful that God has provided us with such a bountiful feast, and that we are all together for this heartwarming occasion.” 
“We have been luckier than most, and we should be glad that we have not lost any of those who matter to us.” 
“Let us take a moment of silence for the McMillers, who have lost their eldest son and youngest daughter to the Freeze.” I involuntarily glance outside, at the living ice flying about the air, its cold heart consuming the poor souls who wander inside its body. I’ve always hated the Freeze.
“This year, we will skip taking turns and giving our thanks, for I believe we are thankful for the same things. Being inside, safe and warm from the Freeze,” True. “Having family and feast alike to weather the raging storm outside,” Kinda. “And resting peacefully, knowing all the nonbelievers in our great God have received punishment this year.” 
 “With that, I conclude prayer. Enjoy your meal, everyone.”
My stomach reeling, I glance at this year’s “turkey.” Apparently poor Anne wasn’t religious enough.Not a normal girl. 
Even though she mostly acted like one. 
Kitten ears, a cat tail, sharp teeth. 
Of course, she looked up to you. 
Must be the reason why she called you, “Master”. 
Unknowingly, you left the front door unlocked when you went to work this morning. 
Somebody got in. 
Ultimately, you came home later than expected. 
Master adoration sparkles in her eyes. 
Even though they lie on the carpet.So yah today I saw a Djinn. The weird thing about this all is I live in Connecticut, so I mean as far as I'm concerned I shouldn't really have to worry about this kind of thing. So today I went to my Aunt's house for thanksgiving and when we got home my little sister needed to go to her friends house to pick up her shirt she left there and for whatever reason both of my parents went. I am a senior in high school so I was outside playing basketball by myself as it became dark, I then noticed something weird. Let me explain my surroundings. My house is on the "main road" of our town about 15 feet above the road on a hill, across the street is a much bigger hill with more houses. Okay I was playing basketball and I looked up on top of the hill across the street and there was a figure, maybe a little taller then a normal human being standing there, arms at it's side, looking at me. Rather staring actually. Or I guess it was because the eyes on this things were so bright I had to turn away almost immediately. They were white and then yellow and back to white every few seconds. I was now squinting to get a better look at it when it became even brighter. At this point I couldn't even look in it's direction. Ya know when u stare at lights and you can see the beems of light coming off of them? Well the beems were all I could see and I was looking 90 degrees away from it in a completely different direction. I ended up running away and by the time I got the balls to look back it's direction it wasn't there. As far as I know that's what a Djinn looks like. Anyone have any ideas as to what it might be?
